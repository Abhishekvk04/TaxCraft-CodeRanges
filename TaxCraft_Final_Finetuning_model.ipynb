Components of Income Tax Here is the key component of income tax, that you should know\\n\\nTaxable surplus generated from the sale of capital assets like\\n\\nTaxable profits earned by self-employed individuals,\\n\\nGross Total Income (GTI): Gross Total Income is the total income earned by the individual business or other entities during a financial year before any deduction or exemption. It includes salaries, wages, profit, capital gains, house property, etc.\\n\\nDeductions: It is expenses or investments that taxpayers can claim to reduce their income amount. There are various sections in the Income Tax Act like Section 80C, Section 80D, Section 80 G, etc. It lowers the tax liability and encourages saving and investments.\\n\\nTaxable Income: It is the income remaining after deducting a deduction from the GTI. It is the amount on which income tax is calculated and paid to the government.\\n\\nTax Slabs and Rates: Income tax in India is levied at progressive tax rates, which means higher incomes attract high-income tax rates. It is revised every year by the government through the union budget.\\n\\nTax Credit: Tax Credits are incentives provided by the government. Common tax credits include deductions for taxes paid in advance (TDS), taxes paid on self-assessment, foreign tax credits for taxes paid in another country, etc.\\n\\nTax Liability: It is the total amount of tax needed to be paid by the taxpayer to the government. It is calculated by applying the applicable tax rates to the taxable income after considering deductions and tax credits.\\n\\nWhat is the Income Tax Regime? Income Tax Regime is the system and framework established by the government to levy taxes on the income earned by individuals, businesses, and other entities within the country. It is a tax slab by the government.\\n\\nLatest New tax regime FY 2023-24 Income up to Rs 3 lakh: Nil\\n\\nIncome Rs 3 lakh to Rs 6 lakh: 5%\\n\\nIncome Rs 6 lakh to Rs 9 lakh: 10%\\n\\nIncome Rs 9 lakh to Rs 12 lakh: 15%\\n\\nIncome Rs 12 lakh to Rs 15 lakh: 20%\\n\\nIncome above Rs 15 lakh: 30%\\n\\nLast Tax Regime FY 2022-23 Income up to Rs 2.5 lakh: Nil\\n\\nIncome Rs 2.5 lakh to Rs 5 lakh: 5%\\n\\nIncome Rs 5 lakh to Rs 7.5 lakh: 10%\\n\\nIncome Rs 7.5 lakh to Rs 10 lakh: 15%\\n\\nIncome Rs 10 lakh to Rs 12.5 lakh: 20%\\n\\nIncome Rs 12.5 lakh to Rs 15 lakh: 25%\\n\\nIncome above Rs 15 lakh: 30%\\n\\nTaxpayers and Tax Slabs – Taxpayers in India are divided into different categories like individuals, Hindu Undivided Families (HUFs), associations of persons (AOPs), and bodies of individuals (BOIs). – Tax rates for firms and Indian companies are fixed, whereas individual taxpayers are taxed based on income slabs. – Income is categorized into blocks called tax slabs, each with a different tax rate. – As income increases, the tax rate also increases, following a progressive tax system. – This means that higher income earners pay a higher percentage of their income in taxes.\\n\\nWhat is the Existing/Old Income Tax Regime? – The old income tax regime had three slab rates: 5%, 20%, and 30%. – Taxpayers could opt for this regime and claim various deductions. – Allowances like Leave Travel Concession (LTC), House Rent Allowance (HRA), and specific other allowances were deductible. – Deductions for tax-saving investments under sections 80C to 80U were allowed. – A standard deduction of Rs 50,000 was applicable. – Taxpayers could also claim a deduction for interest paid on home loans.\\n\\nTax slab rates applicable for Individual taxpayers below 60 years for the Old tax regime are as below:\\n\\nIncome Range\\n\\nTax rate\\n\\nTax to be paid\\n\\nUp to Rs 2,50,000\\n\\n0\\n\\nNo tax\\n\\nRs 2.5 lakhs – Rs 5 lakhs\\n\\n5%\\n\\n5% of your taxable income\\n\\nRs 5 lakhs – Rs 10 lakhs\\n\\n20%\\n\\nRs 12,500+20% on income above Rs 5 lakh\\n\\nAbove 10 lakhs\\n\\n30%\\n\\nRs 1,12,500+30% on income above Rs 10 lakh\\n\\nThere are additional tax slabs for individuals aged 60 and above, as well as those above 80. It’s worth noting that some people mistakenly assume that if they earn Rs. 12 lakh, they’ll pay 30% tax on the entire amount (Rs. 3,60,000). However, under the progressive tax system, someone earning Rs. 12 lakh would pay Rs. 1,12,500 + Rs. 60,000, totaling Rs. 1,72,500.\\n\\nIncome Tax Slabs Under New Tax Regime In the 2020 budget, a new tax system was introduced with reduced tax rates and fewer deductions for Individuals and HUFs. As a result, many taxpayers didn’t choose the new system. However, to promote it in Budget 2023, the income tax slabs for FY 2023-24 (AY 2024-25) have been updated as mentioned below:-\\n\\nNew tax regime FY 2023-24 (After budget)\\n\\nNew tax regime FY 2022-23 (Before budget)\\n\\nIncome up to Rs 3 lakh\\n\\nNil\\n\\nUp to Rs 2.5 lakh\\n\\nNil\\n\\nRs 3 lakh to Rs 6 lakh\\n\\n5%\\n\\nRs 2.5 lakh to Rs 5 lakh\\n\\n5%\\n\\nRs 6 lakh to Rs 9 lakh\\n\\n10%\\n\\nRs 5 lakh to Rs 7.5 lakh\\n\\n10%\\n\\nRs 9 lakh to Rs 12 lakh\\n\\n15%\\n\\nRs 7.5 lakh to Rs 10 lakh\\n\\n15%\\n\\nRs 12 lakh to Rs 15 lakh\\n\\n20%\\n\\nRs 10 lakh to Rs 12.5 lakh\\n\\n20%\\n\\nIncome above Rs 15 lakh\\n\\n30%\\n\\nRs 12.5 lakh to Rs 15 lakh\\n\\n25%\\n\\nIncome above Rs 15 lakh\\n\\n30%\\n\\nUnder the New Tax Regime, many deductions and exemptions are not applicable. However, there are some exemptions and deductions available, such as:\\n\\n1. Transport allowances for specially-abled individuals. 2. Conveyance allowance received for work-related travel expenses. 3. Compensation for travel costs during tours or transfers. 4. Daily allowance for regular expenses during absence from the regular place of work.\\n\\nExceptions to the Income Tax Slab: Capital gains income is taxed differently based on the type of asset and how long it’s been owned. Assets are categorized as long-term or short-term based on the holding period, which varies for different assets.\\n\\nHere’s a summary of the holding period, asset type, and corresponding tax rates:\\n\\nFinancial Year (FY): The financial year is the period from April 1st to March 31st during which income is earned and reported for taxation purposes. For example, FY 2022-23 starts from April 1st, 2022, to March 31st, 2023.\\n\\nAssessment Year (AY): The assessment year follows the financial year, spanning from April 1st to March 31st of the following year. Taxpayers assess their income earned during the financial year and pay taxes during this period. For instance, AY 2023-24 is for incomes earned in FY 2022-23.\\n\\nAssessee: An assessee is an individual or entity that assesses their income and pays taxes according to the Income Tax Act. This includes individuals, partnership firms, companies, Associations of Persons (AOPs), Trusts, etc.\\n\\nWhat is PAN? A PAN, or Permanent Account Number, is a special 10-digit alphanumeric code given by the Indian Income Tax Department to taxpayers. This number serves as a unique identifier for individuals and helps in tracking their tax-related activities. Whenever a person pays taxes or files returns, they must mention their PAN. Additionally, PAN is shared with banks, mutual funds, and other financial entities. This allows the Income Tax Department to monitor all financial transactions associated with that PAN. Essentially, PAN links an individual’s financial activities with the tax department, making it easier for tax authorities to manage taxation processes and track incomes.\\n\\nWhat is TAN? TAN, or Tax Deduction and Collection Account Number, is a unique 10-digit alphanumeric code issued by the Income Tax Department. It is primarily meant for entities responsible for deducting or collecting taxes at the source. Any entity involved in tax deduction (TDS) or tax collection (TCS) must obtain a TAN. This number is crucial for filing TDS/TCS returns, making tax payments, and issuing TDS/TCS certificates. By quoting TAN in all relevant documents and transactions, organizations ensure compliance with tax regulations and facilitate smooth processing of tax-related activities.\\n\\nResidents and Non-residents The levy of income tax in India hinges on the residential status of taxpayers. Residents are individuals who qualify under Indian tax laws and are liable to pay taxes on their worldwide\\n\\nincome, including earnings from both within and outside India. Conversely, non-residents are only required to pay taxes on income earned within India. Determining residential status is crucial and must be done for each financial year separately. This classification ensures that tax liabilities are appropriately assessed based on the taxpayer’s presence and economic activities within the country’s jurisdiction.\\n\\nIncome Tax Payment Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) Tax deducted at source (TDS) is a mechanism where tax is deducted by the payer while making certain payments to the recipient. The recipient can later claim credit for this TDS amount by adjusting it against their final tax liability.\\n\\nAdvance Tax Advance tax is tax paid in advance by taxpayers if their estimated tax liability for the year exceeds Rs 10,000. The government specifies due dates for paying advance tax installments throughout the financial year.\\n\\nSelf-Assessment Tax Self-assessment tax is the balance tax that taxpayers have to pay on their assessed income after adjusting for advance tax and TDS. It is calculated based on the total income tax liability determined by the taxpayer.\\n\\nE-Payment of Taxes Taxpayers can conveniently pay advance tax and self-assessment tax online through the NSDL website. However, they need to have net banking facilities with authorized banks for e-payment.\\n\\nFiling your ITR: A Simple Guide E-filing your income tax return has become mandatory for most taxpayers, except for a few exceptions:\\n\\n1. Taxpayers aged 80 and above are exempt from e-filing. 2. Taxpayers earning less than Rs 5 lakhs and not seeking a refund also do not need to e-file. For everyone else, e-filing is compulsory. The deadline for filing returns is typically July 31 after the financial year ends.\\n\\nIf you miss the deadline, here are the consequences:\\n\\n– You won’t be able to carry forward losses (except for house property loss) to future years. – Your refund claims may be delayed. – Obtaining home loans might become more challenging. – Late filing fees of up to Rs 5,000 (for incomes above Rs 5 lakhs) or Rs 1,000 (for incomes below Rs 5 lakhs) may be levied under Section 234F. – Interest may be charged under Section 234A if taxes are due as of July 31.\\n\\nE-filing offers several benefits beyond just submitting your return.

Income tax is a type of tax that the central government charges on the income earned during a financial year by individuals and businesses. Taxes are sources of revenue for the government. The government utilises this revenue for developing infrastructure, providing healthcare, education, subsidies to the farmer/agriculture sector and other government welfare schemes.\\n\\nTaxes are mainly of two types: direct taxes and indirect taxes. Tax levied directly on the income earned is called a direct tax; for example, Income tax is a direct tax. The tax calculation is based on the income slab rates applicable during that financial year.\\n\\nDirect Taxes are broadly classified as :\\n\\nIncome Tax – This is taxes an individual, a Hindu Undivided Family (HUF), or any taxpayer other than companies pay on the income received. The law prescribes the rate at which such income is taxable. Corporate Tax - This is the tax paid on the company\\'s taxable income. Here again, a specific tax rate for corporations has been prescribed by the income tax laws of India. Who Should Pay Income Tax? – Types Of Taxpayers\\n\\nAccording to the Income Tax Act, everyone in India, whether resident or nonresident, has to file income tax returns. Currently, tax is payable if the income exceeds Rs 3 lakh in a financial year. The Income Tax Act has classified taxpayers into various categories. Different tax rules apply to different types of taxpayers.\\n\\nBelow are the categories of taxpayers:\\n\\nIndividuals Hindu Undivided Family (HUF) Firms Companies Association of Persons(AOP) Body of Individuals (BOI) Local Authority Artificial Judicial Person Further, Individuals and HUFs are classified as residents and nonresidents. Resident individuals are liable to pay tax on their global income in India, i.e. income earned in India and abroad. Meanwhile, those who qualify as nonresidents must only pay taxes on income earned or accrued in India. The residential status has to be determined separately for tax purposes for every financial year based on the individual tenure of stay in India. Resident Individuals are further classified into the mentioned categories for tax purposes:\\n\\nIndividuals less than 60 years of age Individuals aged more than 60 but less than 80 years Types Of Income – What Are The 5 Heads Of Income? Everyone who earns or gets an income in India is subject to income tax (Yes, be it a resident or a non-resident of India). For simpler classification, the Income tax department breaks down income into five main heads:\\n\\nHead of Income\\n\\nNature of Income covered\\n\\nIncome from Other Sources\\n\\nIncome from savings bank account interest, fixed deposits, and winning in lotteries is taxable under this head of income.\\n\\nIncome from House Property\\n\\nIncome earned from renting a house property is taxable under this head of income.\\n\\nIncome from Capital Gains\\n\\nSurplus Income from the sale of a capital asset such as mutual funds, shares, house property, etc, is taxable under this head of Income.\\n\\nIncome from Business and Profession\\n\\nProfits earned by self-employed individuals, businesses, freelancers or contractors and income earned by professionals like life insurance agents, chartered accountants, doctors and lawyers who have their own practice, and tuition teachers are taxable under this head.\\n\\nIncome from Salary\\n\\nIncome earned from salary and pension is taxable under this head of income.\\n\\nTaxpayers and Tax Slabs Each of these taxpayers is taxed differently under the Indian income tax laws. While firms and Indian companies have a fixed rate of tax calculated on taxable income, the individual, HUF, AOP and BOI taxpayers are taxed based on the income slab they fall under. People\\'s income grouped into blocks are called tax brackets or tax slabs. And each tax slab has a different tax rate. The rate at which the tax is charged increases as the taxable income increases.\\n\\nWhat is the Existing/Old Income Tax Regime? The old tax regime provides three slab rates for income tax levy, which are 5%, 20%, and 30% for different income brackets. Individuals can continue with the old taxation regime, and they can claim the following deductions:\\n\\nDeductions of allowances like Leave Travel Concession (LTC), House Rent Allowance (HRA), and specific other allowances. Deductions for tax-saving investments as per Section 80C (LIC, PPF, NPS, etc) to 80U can be claimed. Standard deduction of Rs 50,000. Deduction for interest paid on home loan. Tax slab rates applicable for Individual taxpayers below 60 years for the Old tax regime are as below:\\n\\nIncome Range\\n\\nTax rate\\n\\nTax to be paid\\n\\nUp to Rs 2,50,000\\n\\n0\\n\\nNo tax\\n\\nRs 2.5 lakhs - Rs 5 lakhs\\n\\n5%\\n\\n5% of your taxable income\\n\\nRs 5 lakhs - Rs 10 lakhs\\n\\n20%\\n\\nRs 12,500+20% on income above Rs 5 lakh\\n\\nAbove 10 lakhs\\n\\n30%\\n\\nRs 1,12,500+30% on income above Rs 10 lakh\\n\\nThere are two other tax slabs for two other age groups: those 60 and older and those above 80.\\n\\nA word of note: People often misunderstand that if they earn, let\\'s say, Rs12 lakh, they will be paying a 30% tax on Rs.12 lakh, i.e. Rs 3,60,000. This is incorrect. A person earning Rs 12 lakh in the progressive tax system will pay Rs 1,12,500 + Rs 60,000 = Rs 1,72,500.\\n\\nIncome Tax Slabs Under New Tax Regime In the 2020 budget, a new tax regime was introduced with lower tax rates and limited deductions/exemptions for Individuals and HUFs. Hence, many taxpayers did not opt for the new tax regime. However, to encourage taxpayers to adopt the new tax regime in Budget 2023, the income tax slabs under the new tax regime for FY 2023-24 (AY 2024-25) are revised as follows:\\n\\nNew tax regime FY 2023-24 (After budget)\\n\\nNew tax regime FY 2022-23 (Before budget)\\n\\nIncome up to Rs 3 lakh\\n\\nNil\\n\\nUp to Rs 2.5 lakh\\n\\nNil\\n\\nRs 3 lakh to Rs 6 lakh\\n\\n5%\\n\\nRs 2.5 lakh to Rs 5 lakh\\n\\n5%\\n\\nRs 6 lakh to Rs 9 lakh\\n\\n10%\\n\\nRs 5 lakh to Rs 7.5 lakh\\n\\n10%\\n\\nRs 9 lakh to Rs 12 lakh\\n\\n15%\\n\\nRs 7.5 lakh to Rs 10 lakh\\n\\n15%\\n\\nRs 12 lakh to Rs 15 lakh\\n\\n20%\\n\\nRs 10 lakh to Rs 12.5 lakh\\n\\n20%\\n\\nIncome above Rs 15 lakh\\n\\n30%\\n\\nRs 12.5 lakh to Rs 15 lakh\\n\\n25%\\n\\nIncome above Rs 15 lakh\\n\\n30%\\n\\nMost of the deductions and exemptions are not allowed if the taxpayers opt for the New Tax regime. However, the exemptions and deductions available under the new regime are:\\n\\nTransport allowances in case of a specially-abled person. Conveyance allowance received to meet the conveyance expenditure incurred as part of the employment. Any compensation received to meet the cost of travel on tour or transfer. Daily allowance received to meet the ordinary regular charges or expenditures you incur on account of absence from his regular place of duty. Exceptions To The Income Tax Slab One must remember that not all income can be taxed on a slab basis. Capital gains income is an exception to this rule. Capital gains are taxed depending on your asset and how long you’ve owned it. The holding period would determine if assets are long-term or short-term. The holding period to determine the nature of assets differs for different assets. A glance at the holding period, the nature of the assets and the tax rate for each are given below.\\n\\nFinancial Year The financial year is a one-year period that the taxpayers use for accounting and financial reporting purposes. It is the year in which the income is earned. According to the Income Tax Act, such a period begins from 1st April of the calendar year to 31st March of the next calendar year. It is abbreviated as “FY”. For example, the financial year starting from 1st April 2023 and ending on 31st March 2024 can be written as FY 2023-24.\\n\\nIn simple words, a financial year is a year in which the income of a person is earned.\\n\\nAssessment Year The one year from 1st April to 31st March starting immediately after the financial year is termed an assessment year. This period is the assessment year because all the taxpayers have to evaluate their income earned in the financial year and pay taxes this year. For example, for incomes earned during the FY 2023-24, the assessment year will be AY 2024-25.\\n\\nIn simple words, the income earned in the financial year will be assessed to tax in the assessment year.\\n\\nAssessee\\n\\nThe assessee is a person or a group who assesses his/her income and pays tax as per the Income Tax Act. The assessee can be an individual, a partnership firm, a company, an Association of Persons (AOP), a Trust, etc.\\n\\nWhat is PAN? PAN is an abbreviation for the Permanent Account Number. It is a unique 10-digit alphanumeric digit issued by the Income Tax Department to Indian taxpayers. All the tax-related transactions and information of a person are recorded against their unique permanent account number. When the person has to pay advance tax or self-assessment tax, they must mention the PAN number.\\n\\nAlso, an individual submits his PAN to certain entities like banks, mutual fund companies, etc. The financial information from such entities goes to the income tax department via PAN. This allows the taxman to link all tax-related activities with the department. Hence, just by putting in a permanent account number, the taxman can identify all your financial transactions.\\n\\nWhat is TAN? TAN is an abbreviation for Tax Deduction and Collection Account Number. It is a unique 10-digit alphanumeric digit allotted by the Income Tax Department of India. All persons responsible for deduction (TDS) or collection of tax (TCS) are required to obtain TAN. It is compulsory to quote the TAN in TDS/TCS return, any TDS/TCS payment challan, and TDS/TCS certificates.\\n\\nResidents and Non-Residents Levy of income tax in India is dependent on the residential status of a taxpayer. Individuals who qualify as a resident in India must pay tax on their global income in India, i.e. income earned in India and abroad. Whereas, those who qualify as Non-residents need to pay taxes only on their Indian income. The residential status has to be determined separately for every financial year for which income and taxes are computed.\\n\\nIncome Tax Payment Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) For specified payments, tax is deducted at source when paying the recipient of income. The income recipient can claim credit of the TDS amount by adjusting it with the final tax liability.\\n\\nAdvance Tax The taxpayer must pay tax in advance when his estimated income tax liability for the year exceeds Rs 10,000. The government has specified due dates for payment of advance tax installments.\\n\\nSelf-Assessment Tax It is the balance tax that the taxpayer has to pay on the assessed income. The self-assessment tax is calculated after reducing the advance tax and TDS from the total income tax calculated on the assessed income.\\n\\nE-Payment of Taxes Taxpayers can pay advance tax and self-assessment tax online from the e-filing website. Click here to learn how to pay taxes online through e-filing portal.\\n\\nFiling Your ITR E-filing of income tax return has been made mandatory for all classes of taxpayers, barring a few exceptions:\\n\\nTaxpayers aged 80 and above need not e-file the return. Taxpayers having an income less than Rs 5 lakhs and not claiming a refund need not e-file the return. For the rest, E-filing is mandatory. Do note that deadlines for filing returns have also been prescribed. For most individual taxpayers, the due date for filing the return of income is 31 July, immediately following the concerned financial year. If you do not file on time, here are some disadvantages:\\n\\nYou will be denied carry forward of losses (except house property loss) to future years. Delay processing of refund claims if any. Difficulty on getting home loans. Levy of late filing fee upto Rs 5,000 (if the total income is above Rs 5 lakh) and Rs 1,000 (if the total income is below Rs 5 lakh) under Section 234F. Levy of interest under 234A if there are taxes due as on 31 July. E-filing is a better alternative to filing on the income tax website. Also, it is for more than just e-filing your income tax return.\\n\\nTax Craft helps you claim all the deductions you’re eligible for and enables you to invest. Once you file your return online, you either e-verify the same or take a print of the ITR V and send it to CPC, Bengaluru, for processing your return.\\n\\nRead our detailed article on e-verification of return of income.\\n\\nHere’s a guide to e-filing your first tax return on Tax Craft.\\n\\nIncome Tax Return The taxpayer shall file an income tax return every year via ITR forms prescribed by the income tax department. The government has prescribed seven ITR forms through which the taxpayer can file his income tax return. The taxpayer has to choose the appropriate ITR forms and file his income tax return.\\n\\nIncome Tax Forms List The seven ITR forms are:\\n\\nITR-1: Individuals (residents) having income from salary, one house property, other sources, agricultural income less than Rs 5,000 and with a total income of up to Rs 50 lakh.\\n\\nITR-2: Individuals/HUFs not having any business or profession under any proprietorship, more than one house property. ITR-3: Individuals/HUFs having income from a proprietary business or profession, income of a person as a partner in a firm. ITR-4: Individuals/HUFs having presumptive income from business or profession, one house property. ITR-5: Partnership firms or LLPs. ITR-6: Companies. ITR-7: Trusts. Documents Required for ITR Filing Form 16, Form 26AS, AIS, TIS, Form 16A, proof of tax saving investments made, bank account details, etc, are some of the crucial information/documents you need to be ready with before filing your return. Further, the documents you will need to file your tax return will largely depend on your source of income. Here is our detailed article on documents you need for filing of your return of income.\\n\\nHow can I calculate my income tax?\\n\\nIndividuals should calculate income tax depending on the nature of their income. The salaried individual can take the eligible exemptions available for various allowances received. Individuals/HUF can take a deduction under Sections 80C to 80U, deduct it from the gross total income, and calculate the income tax liability. Also, the total income tax liability should be adjusted by the taxes paid, such as advance tax, TDS, etc.\\n\\nAlso, the taxpayer should apply the effect of rebate under Section 87A and relief under Section 89, Section 90, and Section 91 to arrive at the net amount of income tax payable.\\n\\nAny income that you receive should form part of your income tax return. Of course, the law provides exemptions for certain incomes, e.g. LTCG on listed equity shares up to Rs 1 lakh in any financial year, agricultural income, etc. Therefore, here is a quick guideline you can probably follow to compute taxes due on your income:\\n\\nList down all your income – be it salary, rental income, capital gains, interest income or profits from your business or profession. Remove incomes that are exempt under the law. Claim all applicable deductions available under every source of income. E.g., claim a standard deduction of Rs 50,000 from salary income, claim municipal taxes from rental income, claim business-related expenses from your business turnover, etc. Claim all applicable exemptions under every head of income, e.g., amount reinvested in another house property can be claimed as exemption from capital gains income, etc. Claim applicable deductions from your total income, e.g. the Section 80 deductions like 80C, 80D, 80TTA, 80TTB, etc. You will now arrive at your taxable income. Check the tax slab you fall under and accordingly arrive at your income tax payable.\\n\\nThe government keeps introducing and altering tax slabs, schemes and tax benefits, so it’s a good idea to keep up with the Budget.\\n\\nWhat Is Computation Of Income? The process of calculating taxable income after taking into account the income from all the five heads (salary, house property, capital gains, business or profession, and other sources), exemptions, deductions, rebates, set off of losses, etc., is called computation of income. After the computation of income, the taxpayer can compute the income tax liability as per the Income Tax Act.\\n\\nRebate u/s 87A Rebates under Section 87A allow taxpayers to reduce their income tax liability. If you are a resident individual and the amount of your total income after reducing Chapter VI-A deductions (Section 80C, 80D, 80U, etc) does not exceed Rs 5 lakh in a financial year, you can claim a tax rebate up to Rs 12,500. This means if your total tax payable is less than Rs 12,500, then you will not have to pay any tax.\\n\\nIn Budget 2023, a tax rebate on income of Rs 7 lakhs has been introduced under the new tax regime, and no changes have been made in the 2024 interim budget. Therefore, you do not have to pay tax if your taxable income is up to Rs 7 lakhs under the new tax regime.\\n\\nE-File Returns The taxpayer shall electronically file the income tax return through the e-filing platform of the IT department. To file the income tax return, the taxpayer should register at www.incometax.gov.in. After that, the taxpayer can log in to the website and file his ITR. Also, there is no need to manually send the acknowledgement of the return to the income tax department. The income tax department now allows e-verification of the ITR in different ways, which completes the income tax return process.\\n\\nWhat is ITR–V? Form ITR-V is an income tax return verification form generated after the taxpayer files income tax return and submits it to the income tax department. The ITR-V should be e-verified or must be sent to CPC Bangalore at “Income Tax Department – CPC, Post Box No – 1, Electronic City Post Office, Bangalore – 560100, Karnataka” for verification. The ITR processing takes place only if its verification is completed.\\n\\nDid You E-file Your Tax Return For This Year? You can file your Income Tax Return on Tax Craft.

This needn’t be so. To help\\n\\nyou understand the tax implications of your income (based on your income\\n\\nsource), here is a compilation of basics of income tax for beginners.\\n\\nBasics of Income Tax for Beginners\\n\\nAre you just out of college and looking for a job? Or have you already landed\\n\\nthe job and are going to file your income tax returns for the first time? If\\n\\nnitty-gritty of income tax and investments confuse you, Tax Craft is here to\\n\\nhelp. Our aim at Tax Craft is to simplify Income Taxes for you and make your\\n\\nfinancial lives easier. Basically, anybody with an income is liable to file income\\n\\ntax returns. Today we bring to you the basics of Income Tax you’ll need to\\n\\nequip yourself with and this should help you take a confident first step into\\n\\nyour job.\\n\\nDefining the ‘Previous year’\\n\\nPrevious year or the financial year or your tax year is the 12 month period that\\n\\nbegins on 1st April and ends on the 31st March of the next year. No matter\\n\\nwhen you start your job, your tax year closes on 31st March and a new tax\\n\\nyear starts on 1st April. So, it is important to plan your taxes for each financial\\n\\nyear.\\n\\nAssessment Year\\n\\nIt is a term you’ll often hear in relation to tax filing. It is the financial year after\\n\\nthe previous year in which you will ‘assess’ and file your return for the\\n\\nprevious year. So, assessment year is 2019-20 for the previous year 2018-19.\\n\\nAssessment year is the year in which you will file your return for the previous\\n\\nyear. For instance, if you start your job on 1 January 2023, your tax year\\n\\ncloses on 31 March 2023. 2022-23 is your previous year and your AY is\\n\\n2023-24.\\n\\nUnderstanding your Salary\\n\\nWhen you start your job – reach out to your payroll or HR department and get\\n\\nyour Salary details/ Pay Slip / Tax Statement. Here, you will get an idea of the\\n\\nmajor components of your salary and how much tax will be deducted from\\n\\nyour salary based on them.\\n\\nExample: Most companies give House Rent Allowance or HRA, and you can\\n\\nsave tax on that if you are living on rent.\\n\\nIncome on which you pay Tax\\n\\nBesides the salary income you receive, you may be earning an income from\\n\\nseveral other sources. Your Total Income is the sum total of all heads of\\n\\nincome below.\\n\\nSources of Income\\n\\nSources of\\n\\nIncome\\n\\nIncome from\\n\\nSalary\\n\\nIncome from\\n\\nHouse Property\\n\\nIncome from\\n\\nCapital Gain\\n\\nParticulars\\n\\nSalary, Allowances, Leave encashment basically all the\\n\\nmoney you receive while rendering your job as a result\\n\\nof your employment agreement\\n\\nIncome from house or building, this may be owned and\\n\\nself-occupied or may be rented\\n\\nIncome from gain or loss when you sell a capital asset\\n\\nIncome from\\n\\nIncome/loss that arises as a result of carrying on a\\n\\nBusiness or\\n\\nbusiness or profession\\n\\nProfession\\n\\nIncome from\\n\\nThis is the residual head – includes your income from\\n\\nOther Sources\\n\\nsavings bank accounts,fixed deposits,family pension or\\n\\ngifts received\\n\\nDeductions\\n\\nDeductions reduce your Gross Income. These are the amounts Income Tax\\n\\nDepartment allows you to reduce your Income, bringing down your tax liability.\\n\\nSum of All heads of Income = Gross Income\\n\\nGross Income – Deductions = Taxable Income\\n\\nThe more you make use of the deductions allowed, the lower your tax shall\\n\\nbe. Deductions are allowed under Section 80 of the Income Tax Act (Section\\n\\n80C to 80U).\\n\\nHowever, in 2020, the government introduced two tax regimes in India: The\\n\\nold tax regime and the new tax regime. The percentage of income tax that you\\n\\npay on your total income differs under the old and the new tax regime. Click\\n\\nhere to know more about the old and the new tax regimes.\\n\\nUnder the old tax regime, all deductions are allowed under Sections 80C to\\n\\n80U, subject to conditions. However, under the new tax regime, only the\\n\\ndeduction on let-out property under Section 24B and the deduction on the\\n\\nemployer\\'s contribution to NPS are allowed.\\n\\nDeductions Under Section 80C\\n\\nSection 80C can take off INR 1,50,000 from your Gross Income. Given below\\n\\nare some of the widely-used investment vehicles under this section.\\n\\nPPF\\n\\nOne of the most popular deductions under 80C is deposits to Public Provident\\n\\nFund or PPF. When you open a PPF account, you need to deposit a minimum\\n\\nof INR 500 and a maximum of INR 1,50,000 in a year. Money deposited in a\\n\\nPPF account compounds, as you deposit more money in the subsequent\\n\\nfinancial years to claim deductions. PPF is a traditional and safe saving\\n\\navenue to park your hard earned money. A PPF account can be easily\\n\\nopened with a bank.\\n\\nTax-saving FD\\n\\nFixed deposits assure capital protection as well as a sizable interest income\\n\\nfor investors. To get tax benefits under 80C, you need to stay invested for at\\n\\nleast 5 years. It is safe, but the Interest Income from it is taxable.\\n\\nTax-saving mutual funds or ELSS\\n\\nOne of the only mutual fund scheme allowed under 80C, ELSS (Equity Linked\\n\\nSavings Scheme) is gaining popularity among people for its historically higher\\n\\nperformance in the recent years. Another perk of ELSS is that it has the\\n\\nlowest lock-in period of 3 years.\\n\\nTDS or Tax deducted at source\\n\\nTDS is Tax Deducted at Source – it means that the tax is deducted by the\\n\\nperson making payment. The payer has to deduct an amount of tax based on\\n\\nthe rules prescribed by the income tax department. For instance, An employer\\n\\nwill estimate the total annual income of an employee and deduct tax on his\\n\\nIncome if his Taxable Income exceeds INR 2,50,000. Tax is deducted based\\n\\non which tax slab you belong to each year. Similarly, if you earn interest from\\n\\na Fixed Deposit, the bank also deducts TDS. Since the bank does not know\\n\\nyour tax slabs, they usually deduct TDS @ 10%, unless you haven’t\\n\\nmentioned your PAN (in that case a 20% TDS may be deducted).\\n\\nCalculating Tax Payable\\n\\nOn your Taxable Income, tax slabs or rates are applied and final tax payable\\n\\nis calculated. From this tax payable, you can reduce all the TDS that has\\n\\nalready been deducted.\\n\\nYou can always use our Tax Calculator!\\n\\nStandard Deduction\\n\\nAs per the Budget 2018, salaried employees are entitled to a standard\\n\\ndeduction of Rs 40,000 from the gross salary. This standard deduction will\\n\\nreplace the medical reimbursement amounting to INR 15,000 and transport\\n\\nallowance amounting to Rs. 19,200 in a financial year. Effectively, the\\n\\ntaxpayer will get an additional income exemption of Rs 5,800. The limit of Rs.\\n\\n40,000 has been increased to Rs. 50,000 from FY 2019-20 onwards in the\\n\\nInterim Budget 2019. From FY 2023-2024, this deduction of Rs.50,000 is\\n\\navailable and can be claimed under both the old and new tax regimes.\\n\\nIllustration on salary TDS\\n\\nAditya is a 25-year-old software engineer living in Mumbai.

With this deduction, his taxable income does not exceed Rs 5 lakh which\\n\\nis eligible for rebate under section 87A for the AY 2020-21.\\n\\nHowever, Aditya has to file an income tax return because his gross total\\n\\nincome is above the basic exemption limit of Rs 2.5 lakh. Also, Aditya can\\n\\nclaim a refund of the TDS of Rs 29,880 which has been deducted on his\\n\\nincome. Aditya claims Rs 1,50,000 under section 80C. Deduction on Section\\n\\n80C is available for PF @12% of Basic Salary, its Rs 43,200 for him.

The income tax department will\\n\\nrecompute the taxes and validate the refund claim before initiating the refund.\\n\\nFor example: Assume Mr. Gupta paid 3 lakh as an advance tax during the\\n\\nfinancial year.

The new form is in line with the Budget\\n\\n2020 announcement to facilitate compliance and correct payment of taxes.\\n\\nIntroduction of Annual Information Statement (AIS)\\n\\nNow again, the tax department has introduced an Annual Information\\n\\nStatement (AIS) to incorporate new details like foreign remittances, off-market\\n\\ntransactions, interest on income tax refunds, mutual fund purchases and\\n\\ndividend details, and break-up details of salary and ITR information of another\\n\\nperson.\\n\\nThe income tax department used to already avail these records from the\\n\\nauthorised entities. For instance, an authorised dealer (e.g. banks) submits\\n\\nForm 15CC for every payment made to non-residents, transfer agents, and\\n\\ndepositories report off-market transactions (gift transfers, legacy transfers,\\n\\ntransfers between two Demat accounts, etc.). Further, salary break-up details\\n\\nare available in Form 16 from details uploaded by employers on the TRACES\\n\\nportal.\\n\\nMoreover, information related to certain transactions undertaken by the\\n\\ntaxpayers is available with the tax department through ITR filed by others. For\\n\\nexample, the property seller reports buyers\\' details in their ITR.\\n\\nBenefits of Annual Information Statement (AIS)\\n\\n\\n\\nThe department is also working to remove errors or duplication of\\n\\nthe information in the new report. The AIS statement has a feature\\n\\nto submit online feedback if the details reflected are inaccurate. In\\n\\ncase of inaccuracy or errors, the taxpayer can provide feedback\\n\\nrequesting a modification. The taxpayer can also submit feedback\\n\\nfor bulk information. Further, an AIS offline utility is also available\\n\\nto upload feedback offline. Taxpayers can download the AIS in\\n\\nPDF, CSV, and JSON formats.\\n\\nThe AIS report has two parts: (i) Taxpayers Information Summary\\n\\n(TIS) and (ii) Annual Information Statement (AIS). TIS is a\\n\\nsimplified statement showing aggregate value, whereas AIS is a\\n\\ncomprehensive statement. TIS shows the processed value (i.e. the\\n\\nvalue according to income tax records) and derived value (i.e. the\\n\\nvalue modified after considering the taxpayer\\'s feedback). On\\n\\nfeedback submission, the derived information in TIS will\\n\\nautomatically update in real-time.\\n\\nThe new AIS statement will simplify the ITR filing for taxpayers as\\n\\nmore details are available in just one statement. Taxpayers can\\n\\nidentify incorrect information reported in AIS and provide feedback\\n\\nfor corrective action.\\n\\nAlso, tax authorities would easily compare the information reported\\n\\nby the taxpayer with the source and identify any mismatch. This\\n\\nwill reduce the issue of notice by the income tax department and\\n\\ntax leakages.\\n\\nTDS Certificate (Form 16/16A) and Form 26AS\\n\\nA TDS certificate or Form 16/16A and Form 26AS have different purposes\\n\\nthough they may seem to contain the same information. You can gather all\\n\\nrelevant information related to TDS in Form 26AS, sufficient to file ITR.\\n\\nHowever, there is a need to obtain a TDS Certificate. The rationale behind\\n\\nintroducing Form 26AS was to enable the taxpayers to cross-check and verify\\n\\ntheir details in the TDS certificates with the details recorded in Form 26AS and\\n\\nmaintain transparency of information.\\n\\nWhen you do not have a TDS certificate or Form 26AS, you cannot verify your\\n\\ndetails and find mismatches that may have occurred. When you have both,\\n\\nyou can cross-check, compare the details and find discrepancies, if any. In the\\n\\ncase there are discrepancies, you can get it corrected.\\n\\nFurther, in the case of salaried persons, Form 26AS is not sufficient to file ITR\\n\\nsince it does not show the break-up of the income and deductions claimed\\n\\nunder Section 80C to Section 80U which are available in TDS certificate.\\n\\nThus, you need a TDS certificate along with Form 26AS.\\n\\nThings to verify in TDS certificate with Form 26AS\\n\\nForm 26AS must be verified with the details of TDS certificate, i.e. Form 16\\n\\n(for salaried individuals) and Form 16A (for non-salaried individuals), to\\n\\nensure that the TDS deducted from the payee’s income was deposited with\\n\\nthe income tax department.\\n\\nOther things that taxpayers must verify in the TDS certificate and Form 26AS\\n\\nare as follows:\\n\\nCheck the name, PAN number, deductor’s TAN, refund amount\\n\\nand TDS amount to ensure that they are correctly reflected. A\\n\\nmismatch in details may create problems while filing ITR.\\n\\nVerify if the Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) amount, as shown in\\n\\nthe TDS certificate, has been received by the government.\\n\\nTaxpayers can verify this by comparing the TDS data on the\\n\\npayslips with the Form 26AS data. If the deductor has not filed or\\n\\nsubmitted the TDS on your behalf, contact the deductor and ask\\n\\nhim/her to file the TDS return and submit the tax amount at the\\n\\nearliest.\\n\\nCheck if the TDS mentioned in Form 16/16A is reflecting in Form\\n\\n26AS correctly. When the TDS shown in the TDS certificate is not\\n\\nreflecting in Form 26AS, it means that the deductor has deducted\\n\\nthe tax on your behalf but has not deposited it with the income tax\\n\\ndepartment. In such a case, you need to take action and contact\\n\\nthe deductor to recify it.\\n\\nIn the case of any discrepancy between the TDS certificate and Form 26AS,\\n\\ninform your deductor and get it corrected immediately. Ensure that the\\n\\ndeductor has filed TDS using your PAN number and other details. In many\\n\\ncases, if the TDS is filed under an incorrect PAN, it can result in problems for\\n\\nyou and the deductor.\\n\\nFrequently Asked Questions How do I download the Tax Credit Statement or Form 26AS?

It is important to\\n\\nunderstand your tax slab and what each of your salary breakup components\\n\\nmeans. This can help you figure out how to save on taxes. If you want to\\n\\nunderstand your salary components or want to learn how you can save tax on\\n\\nyour salary income, this guide is for you.\\n\\nSECTION I – Understanding Your Payslip\\n\\nBasic Salary\\n\\nThis is a fixed component in your paycheck and forms the basis of other\\n\\nportions of your salary, hence the name. For instance, HRA is defined as a\\n\\npercentage (as per the company’s discretion) of this basic salary. Your PF is\\n\\ndeducted at 12% of your basic salary. It is usually a large portion of your total\\n\\nsalary.\\n\\nHouse Rent Allowance (HRA)\\n\\nSalaried individuals, who live in a rented house/apartment, can claim house\\n\\nrent allowance or HRA to lower tax outgo. This can be partially or completely\\n\\nexempt from taxes. The income tax laws have prescribed a method for\\n\\ncomputing the HRA that can be claimed as an exemption.\\n\\nRead more about how to claim HRA exemption.\\n\\nAlso, do note that if you receive HRA and don’t live on rent your HRA shall be\\n\\nfully taxable.\\n\\nCase Study: Malavika works at an MNC in Bangalore. Her company provides\\n\\nher with a house rent allowance (HRA). But she doesn’t live in rented\\n\\naccommodation as she lives with her parents.\\n\\nHow can Malavika make use of this allowance?\\n\\nMalavika can pay rent to her parents and claim the allowance provided they\\n\\nown the place they currently live in. All she has to do is enter into a rental\\n\\nagreement with her parents and transfer money to them every month. This\\n\\nway Malavika can make a nice gesture and give back to her parents, and two,\\n\\nsave some taxes. But remember, Malavika’s parents will have to show the rent\\n\\nshe paid in their income tax returns.\\n\\nLeave Travel Allowance\\n\\nSalaried employees can avail exemption for a trip within India under LTA. The\\n\\nexemption is only for the shortest distance on a trip. This allowance can only\\n\\nbe claimed for a trip taken with your spouse, children, and parents, but not\\n\\nwith other relatives. This particular exemption is up to the actual expenses,\\n\\ntherefore unless you actually take the trip and incur these expenses, you\\n\\ncannot claim it. Submit the bills to your employer to claim this exemption.\\n\\nBonus\\n\\nThe bonus is usually paid once or twice a year. Bonus, performance incentive,\\n\\nwhatever may be its name, is 100% taxable. Performance bonus is usually\\n\\nlinked to your appraisal ratings or your performance during a period and is\\n\\nbased on the company policy.\\n\\nEmployee Contribution to Provident Fund (PF)\\n\\nProvident Fund or PF is a social security initiative by the Government of India.\\n\\nBoth employer and employee contribute a 12% equivalent of the employee’s\\n\\nbasic salary every month toward the employee’s pension and provident fund.\\n\\nAs per the Union Budget 2023, the current EPF interest rate remains\\n\\nunchanged at 8.10%. However, the TDS rate for taxable EPF withdrawals has\\n\\nbeen reduced to 20% from 30% for non-PAN holders. This is a retirement\\n\\nbenefit that companies with over 20 employees must provide as per the EPF\\n\\nAct, 1952.\\n\\nStandard Deduction\\n\\nStandard Deduction was reintroduced in the 2018 budget. This deduction has\\n\\nreplaced the conveyance allowance and medical allowance. The employee\\n\\ncan now claim a flat Rs.50,000 (Prior to Budget 2019, it was Rs.40,000)\\n\\ndeduction from the total income, thereby reducing the tax outgo.\\n\\nIn the recent Union Budget 2023-24, a standard deduction of Rs.50,000 was\\n\\nintroduced under the new tax regime, which was previously available only\\n\\nunder the old tax regime.\\n\\nProfessional Tax\\n\\nProfessional tax or tax on employment is a tax levied by a state, just like\\n\\nincome tax which is levied by the central government. The maximum amount\\n\\nof professional tax that can be levied by a state is Rs 2,500. It is usually\\n\\ndeducted by the employer and deposited with the state government. In your\\n\\nincome tax return, professional tax is allowed as a deduction from your salary\\n\\nincome.\\n\\nSECTION II- Difference Between Take Home Salary and CTC\\n\\nYour job may entitle you to some benefits in the form of food coupons or a cab\\n\\nservice apart from your salary. The total cost to the company is the sum of all\\n\\nthe benefits offered plus your salary.\\n\\nBelow is an example of components of your CTC that is on your offer letter.\\n\\nComponents\\n\\nBasic salary\\n\\nSpecial allowance\\n\\nCTC\\n\\nAmount\\n\\nRs 3,00,000\\n\\nRs 1,00,000\\n\\nHRA\\n\\nMedical insurance\\n\\nPF (12% of basic)\\n\\nPerformance bonus\\n\\nRs 80,000\\n\\nRs 5,000\\n\\nRs 36,000\\n\\nRs 75,000\\n\\nTotal CTC\\n\\nRs 5,96,000\\n\\nThis is how your payslip will look for the CTC mentioned above.\\n\\nTaxable Salary\\n\\nComponents\\n\\nAmount\\n\\nBasic salary\\n\\nRs 3,00,000\\n\\nSpecial allowance\\n\\nHRA\\n\\nBonus received\\n\\nTotal salary\\n\\nRs 1,00,000\\n\\nRs 80,000\\n\\nRs 75,000\\n\\nRs 5,55,000\\n\\nLess: 12% PF\\n\\nRs 36,000\\n\\nLess: Tax payable*\\n\\nRs 14,976\\n\\nTake home salary\\n\\nRs 5,04,024\\n\\nBroadly your CTC will include:\\n\\na.

Minus: Income taxes payable (calculated after considering Section 80\\n\\ndeductions).\\n\\nSECTION III – Retirement Benefits\\n\\nExemption of Leave Encashment\\n\\nCheck with your employer about their leave encashment policy. Some\\n\\nemployers allow you to carry forward some amount of leave days and allow\\n\\nyou to encash them, while others prefer that you finish using them in the same\\n\\nyear itself. The amount received as compensation for leave days accumulated\\n\\nis referred to as leave encashment, and it is taxable as salary.\\n\\nExemption of leave encashment from tax:\\n\\nIt is fully exempt for Central and State government employees. For\\n\\nnon-government employees, the least of the following three is exempt.\\n\\na. 10 months average salary preceding retirement or resignation (where\\n\\naverage salary includes basic and DA and excludes perquisites and\\n\\nallowances).\\n\\nb. Leave encashment received (this is further subject to a limit of Rs 3,00,000\\n\\nfor retirements after 02.04.1998).\\n\\nc. Amount equal to salary for the leave earned (where leave earned should\\n\\nnot exceed 30 days for every year of service)\\n\\nThe amount chargeable to tax shall be the total leave encashment received\\n\\nminus the exemption calculated above. This is added to your income from\\n\\nyour salary.\\n\\nRelief Under Section 89(1)\\n\\nYou are allowed tax relief under Section 89(1) when you have received a\\n\\nportion of your salary in arrears or in advance or have received a family\\n\\npension in arrears.\\n\\nCalculate the Tax Relief Yourself\\n\\na. Calculate the tax payable on the total income, including additional salary in\\n\\nthe year it is received.\\n\\nb. Calculate the tax payable on the total income, excluding additional salary in\\n\\nthe year it is received\\n\\nc. Calculate the difference between Step 1 and Step 2\\n\\nd. Calculate the tax payable on the total income of the year to which the\\n\\narrears relate, excluding arrears.\\n\\ne. Calculate the tax payable on the total income of the year to which the\\n\\narrears relate, including arrears\\n\\nf. Calculate the difference between Step 4 and Step 5\\n\\ng. The excess amount at Step 3 over Step 6 is the tax relief that shall be\\n\\nallowed.\\n\\nNote: The amount at Step 6 is more than the amount at Step 3, no relief shall\\n\\nbe allowed.\\n\\nExemption on Receipts at the Time of Voluntary Retirement\\n\\nAny compensation received on voluntary retirement or separation is exempt\\n\\nfrom tax as per Section 10(10C). However, the following conditions must be\\n\\nfulfilled\\n\\na. Compensation received is towards voluntary retirement or separation.\\n\\nb. Maximum compensation received does not exceed Rs 5,00,000.\\n\\nc. The recipient is an employee of an authority established under the Central\\n\\nor State Act, local authority, university, IIT, state government, or central\\n\\ngovernment, notified institute of management, or notified institute of\\n\\nimportance throughout India or any state, PSU, company, or cooperative\\n\\nsociety.\\n\\nd. The receipts comply with Rule 2BA.\\n\\nNo exemption can be claimed under this section for the same AY or any other\\n\\nif relief under Section 89 has been taken by an employee for compensation of\\n\\nvoluntary retirement or separation or termination of services.\\n\\nNote: Exemption can only be claimed in the assessment year the\\n\\ncompensation is received.\\n\\nPension\\n\\nPension is taxable under the head salaries in the income tax return. Pension\\n\\nis paid out periodically monthly usually. You may also choose to take a\\n\\npension as a lump sum (also called a commuted pension) instead of a\\n\\nperiodical payment. At the time of retirement, you may choose to receive a\\n\\ncertain percentage of your pension in advance.\\n\\nSuch pension received in advance is called commuted pension. E.g., At the\\n\\nage of 60, you decide to receive in advance 10% of your monthly pension for\\n\\nthe next 10 years of Rs 10,000. This will be paid to you as a lump sum.\\n\\nTherefore, 10% of 10000x12x10 = 1,20,000 is your commuted pension. You\\n\\nwill continue to receive Rs 9,000 (your uncommuted pension) for the next 10\\n\\nyears until you are 70, and post 70 years of age, you will be paid your full\\n\\npension of Rs 10,000.\\n\\nUncommuted pension or any periodical payment of pension is fully taxable as\\n\\nsalary. In the above case, Rs 9,000 received by you is fully taxable. Rs 10,000\\n\\nstarting at the age of 70 years is fully taxable as well.\\n\\nExemption on Commuted Pension\\n\\nCommuted pension or lump sum received may be exempt in certain cases.\\n\\nFor a government employee, a commuted pension is fully exempt.\\n\\nUncommuted pension or any periodical payment of pension is fully taxable as\\n\\nsalary.\\n\\nIn the above case, Rs 9,000 received by you is fully taxable Rs 10,000\\n\\nstarting at the age of 70 years is fully taxable as well. For a non-government\\n\\nemployee, it is partially exempt.\\n\\nIf gratuity is also received with a pension – 1/3rd of the amount of pension that\\n\\nwould have been received if 100% of the pension was commuted is exempt\\n\\nfrom the commuted pension, and the remaining is taxed as salary.\\n\\nIf only the pension is received, gratuity is not received, then ½ of the amount\\n\\nof pension that would have been received if 100% of the pension was\\n\\ncommuted is exempt.\\n\\nPension received by a family member, though is taxed under ‘Income from\\n\\nother sources‘ in the income tax return. If this pension is commuted or is a\\n\\nlump sum payment, it is not taxable. An uncommuted pension received by a\\n\\nfamily member is exempt to a certain extent. Rs 15,000 or 1/3rd of the\\n\\nuncommuted pension received – whichever is less is exempt from tax.\\n\\nPension that is received from UNO by its employees or their families is\\n\\nexempt from tax. Pension received by family members of the Armed Forces is\\n\\nalso exempt.\\n\\nGratuity\\n\\nGratuity is a retirement benefit that employers provide for their employees.\\n\\nThe employee is entitled to receive gratuity when he completes five years of\\n\\nservice at that company. It is, however, only paid on retirement or resignation.\\n\\nGratuity received on retirement or death by a central, state or local\\n\\ngovernment employee is fully exempt from tax for the employee or his family.\\n\\nThe tax treatment of your gratuity is different, depending on whether your\\n\\nemployer is covered by the Payment of Gratuity Act. Check with your\\n\\ncompany about its status, and then proceed to calculate.\\n\\nIf your employer is covered by the Payment of Gratuity Act, then the least of\\n\\nthe following three is tax-exempt.\\n\\n15 days\\' salary based on the salary last drawn for every completed\\n\\nyear of service or part thereof in excess of 6 months.\\n\\nRs 20,00,000\\n\\nGratuity actually received\\n\\nIf your employer is not covered under the Payment of Gratuity Act, the least of\\n\\nthe following three is tax-exempt.\\n\\nHalf a month’s salary for each completed year of service. While\\n\\ncalculating completed years, any fraction of a year shall be\\n\\nignored.\\n\\nFor example – if you have worked in an organisation for 14 years and 9\\n\\nmonths, the number of years of employment shall be considered to be 14\\n\\nyears. Here salary is taken as the average salary of the 10 months\\n\\nimmediately before the month in which the person retires.\\n\\nRs 20,00,000\\n\\nGratuity actually received\\n\\nSECTION IV – Basics of Income Tax\\n\\nIncome Chargeable to Tax\\n\\nYour income is not equal to your salary.

Your employer will provide you with a TDS certificate called\\n\\nForm 16 typically around June or July showing you how much tax was\\n\\ndeducted each month.\\n\\nYour bank may also deduct tax at source when you earn interest from a fixed\\n\\ndeposit. The bank deducts TDS at 10% on FDs usually. A 20% TDS is\\n\\ndeducted when the bank does not have your PAN information.\\n\\nForm 16\\n\\nForm 16 is a TDS certificate. The income tax department mandates all\\n\\nemployers to deduct TDS from their salary and deposit it with the government.\\n\\nThe Form 16 certificate contains details about the salary you have earned\\n\\nduring the year and the TDS amount deducted.\\n\\nIt has two parts – Part A with details about the employer and employee name,\\n\\naddress, PAN and TAN details, and TDS deductions.\\n\\nPart B- includes details of salary paid, other incomes, deductions allowed, and\\n\\ntax payable.\\n\\nForm 26AS\\n\\nForm 26AS is a summary of taxes deducted on your behalf and taxes paid by\\n\\nyou.

So be\\n\\nsure to claim all the tax deductions and benefits that apply to you. Section\\n\\n80C of the Income Tax Act can reduce your gross income by Rs 1.5 lakh.\\n\\nThere are a bunch of other deductions under Section 80, such as 80D, 80E,\\n\\n80GG, 80U etc., that reduce your tax liability.\\n\\nFrequently Asked Questions Does salary include all kinds of pension? The definition of salary includes pension. However, a pension is what is\\n\\npayable by an employer or previous employer to an employee. Where a\\n\\npension policy is covered under a contract of employment, i.e. say an\\n\\nemployer bought it, then it is also taxed under salary. However, a pension paid\\n\\nout of any policy with a life insurance company cannot be taxed as salary and\\n\\nwill be taxable under the head “Other source”.\\n\\nWhat are allowances? Are all allowances taxable? Allowances are a part of your salary component. Allowance are provided to\\n\\nemployee for specific purpose eg. HRA is provided for the purpose of\\n\\naccommodation of the employees etc. Most of the allowance are taxable\\n\\nunless specifically exempted u/s 10. For example HRA is exempted 10(13A) ,\\n\\nLTA also comes under exemption.\\n\\nWhat are perquisites? How are they taxed? Employees, as a result of their official position, are given benefits which are\\n\\ncalled perquisites in income tax parlance. These are received over and above\\n\\nthe salary or wages of the employee. E.g. Provision of Rent Free\\n\\nAccommodation, vehicles to employees etc. These perquisites can be taxable\\n\\nor non-taxable depending upon their nature. The valuation of perquisites is\\n\\nprovided under Rule 3 of the Income Tax Rules, 1962. No taxes have been\\n\\ndeducted from my salary by my employer.\\n\\nAre arrears of salary taxable? Yes. Arrears of salary are taxable. However, one can claim relief under\\n\\nSection 89 in this regard.\\n\\nI have losses from house property. I have incurred losses from my business too. Can I set off such losses against my salary income? Losses from house property can be set off against salary income. However,\\n\\nbusiness losses are not allowed to be set off against business income.\\n\\nI have been employed by 2 employers during the same year. Can I claim a basic exemption of Rs 2.5 lakh against each of the salary incomes? Such a basic exemption of Rs 2.5 lakh is for your overall income for the year.\\n\\nYou cannot claim this against various incomes separately. Therefore, you\\n\\nmust sum up all your income during the year including the salary income from\\n\\nboth your employers and then claim, a basic exemption of Rs 2.5 lakh from\\n\\nsuch income.\\n\\nI have been employed by 2 employers during the same year, and because my income did not cross the basic exemption limit under each of the employers, no TDS was done. Should I pay any income taxes on my own? Even if TDS has not been made by any of your employers, in case you have a\\n\\ntaxable income after claiming all deductions applicable to you, you will have to\\n\\npay taxes yourself which is called Self Assessment Tax.\\n\\nCan I claim an HRA benefit if I enter into a rental agreement with my wife? This is not an advisable tax planning measure. The intention of Section\\n\\n10(13A) for claiming HRA as an exemption is to help employees who are\\n\\nforced to live closer to their workplace or sometimes in another city for\\n\\nemployment. Where you get into an arrangement of paying rent to your wife\\n\\nand then claim HRA exemption, it cannot be said to be within the framework\\n\\nof law because a husband and a wife, typically, do not share a commercial\\n\\nrelationship. If such an arrangement catches the eye of the income tax\\n\\ndepartment, it is bound to be viewed as tax evasion.\\n\\n9.New Income Tax Portal :\\n\\nNew Income Tax Portal – Intro & Key Features Of New Income Tax E-Filing Portal | E-filing 2.0 Guide\\n\\nUpdated on: May 22nd, 2024 | 7 min read\\n\\nThe Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) launched the new income tax\\n\\ne-filing portal on 7th June 2021.

Taxation on Selling of Shares\\n\\nTaxation of Income Earned From Selling Shares\\n\\nUpdated on: May 16th, 2024 | 12 min read\\n\\nWe all know that income from salary, rental income and business income is\\n\\ntaxable. But what about income from the sale or purchase of shares? Many\\n\\nhomemakers and retired people spend their time gainfully buying and selling\\n\\nshares but are unsure how this income is taxed. Income/loss from the sale of\\n\\nequity shares is covered under the head ‘Capital Gains’.\\n\\nUnder the head ‘Capital Gains’, income is further classified into:\\n\\n(i) Long-term capital gains\\n\\n(ii) Short-term capital gains\\n\\nThis classification is made according to the holding period of the shares. The\\n\\nholding period means the duration for which the investment is held, starting\\n\\nfrom the date of acquisition till the date of sale or transfer.\\n\\nIt should be noted that the holding periods of shares and securities are\\n\\ndifferent for different classes of capital assets. For income tax purposes,\\n\\nholding periods of listed equity shares and equity mutual funds is different\\n\\nfrom the holding period of debt mutual funds. Their taxability is also different.\\n\\nIn this article, we will cover the tax implications on the listed securities like\\n\\nlisted equity shares, bonds, bonds and debentures listed on a recognized\\n\\nIndian stock exchange, units of UTI and Zero-coupon bonds.\\n\\nTaxation of Gains from Equity Shares\\n\\nShort-Term Capital Gains (STCG)\\n\\nIf equity shares listed on a stock exchange are sold within 12 months of\\n\\npurchase, the seller may make a short-term capital gain (STCG) or incur a\\n\\nshort-term capital loss (STCL). The seller makes short-term capital gains\\n\\nwhen shares are sold at a price higher than the purchase price. Short-term\\n\\ncapital gains are taxable at 15%.\\n\\nCalculation of short-term capital gain = Sale price minus Expenses on Sale\\n\\nminus the Purchase price\\n\\nLet\\'s take a look at an example of STCG tax:\\n\\nIn October 2015, Kuldeep Singh paid Rs.38,750 for 250 shares of a publicly\\n\\ntraded firm at a price of Rs.155 a share. He sold them for Rs.192 a share after\\n\\n5 months for Rs.48,000. Let\\'s see how much money he makes in the short\\n\\nrun.\\n\\nFull sales value - Rs.48,000\\n\\nBrokerage at 0.5% - Rs.240\\n\\nPurchase price - Rs.38,750\\n\\nTherefore short-term capital gain made by Kuldeep will be: Rs.48,000 -\\n\\n(Rs.38,750+ Rs.240) = Rs.9,010\\n\\nWhat if your tax slab rate is 10% or 20% or 30%?\\n\\nA special rate of tax of 15% is applicable to short-term capital gains,\\n\\nirrespective of your tax slab.\\n\\nLong-Term Capital Gains (LTCG)\\n\\nIf equity shares listed on a stock exchange are sold after 12 months of\\n\\npurchase, the seller may make a long-term capital gain (LTCG) or incur a\\n\\nlong-term capital loss (LTCL).\\n\\nBefore the introduction of Budget 2018, the long-term capital gain made on\\n\\nthe sale of equity shares or equity-oriented units of mutual funds was exempt\\n\\nfrom tax, i.e. no tax was payable on gains from the sale of long-term equity\\n\\ninvestments.\\n\\nThe Financial Budget of 2018 took away this exemption. Henceforth, if a seller\\n\\nmakes a long-term capital gain of more than Rs.1 lakh on the sale of equity\\n\\nshares or equity-oriented units of a mutual fund, the gain made will attract a\\n\\nlong-term capital gains tax of 10% (plus applicable cess). Also, the benefit of\\n\\nindexation will not be available to the seller. These provisions will apply to\\n\\ntransfers made on or after 1 April 2018.\\n\\nAlso, this new provision was introduced prospectively, i.e. gains starting from\\n\\nthe 1st of Feb 2018 will only be considered for taxation. This is known as the\\n\\n‘grandfathering rule’. Any long-term gains from the equity instruments\\n\\npurchased before the 31st of January 2018 will be calculated according to this\\n\\n‘grandfathering rule’.\\n\\nExample: Atul purchased shares for Rs.100 on 30th September 2017 and sold\\n\\nthem for Rs.120 on 31st December 2018. The stock value was Rs.110 as of\\n\\n31st January 2018. Out of the capital gains of Rs.20 (i.e. 120-100), Rs.10 (i.e.\\n\\n110-100) is not taxable. Rest Rs.10 is taxable as capital gains at 10% without\\n\\nindexation.\\n\\nThe following table demonstrates the nature of a long-term capital gain tax on\\n\\nshares and other securities.\\n\\nParticulars\\n\\nSTT-paid sales of listed shares on recognized stock\\n\\nexchanges and MFs\\n\\nSTT is paid on the sale of shares, bonds,\\n\\ndebentures, and other listed securities.\\n\\nSale of debt-oriented MFs\\n\\nTax rate\\n\\n10% on amounts over\\n\\nRs 1 lakh\\n\\n10%\\n\\nWith indexation - 20%\\n\\nWithout indexation -\\n\\n10%\\n\\nLoss From Equity Shares\\n\\nShort-Term Capital Loss (STCL)\\n\\nAny short-term capital loss from the sale of equity shares can be offset against\\n\\nshort-term or long-term capital gain from any capital asset. If the loss is not\\n\\nset off entirely, it can be carried forward for eight years and adjusted against\\n\\nany short term or long-term capital gains made during these eight years.\\n\\nIt is worth noting that a taxpayer will only be allowed to carry forward losses if\\n\\nhe has filed his income tax return within the due date. Therefore, even if the\\n\\ntotal income earned in a year is less than the minimum taxable income, filing\\n\\nan income tax return is a must for carrying forward these losses.\\n\\nLong-Term Capital Loss (LTCL)\\n\\nLong-term capital loss from equity shares until Budget 2018 was considered a\\n\\ndead loss – It could neither be adjusted nor carried forward. This is because\\n\\nlong-term capital gains from listed equity shares were exempt. Similarly, their\\n\\nlosses were neither allowed to be set off nor carried forward.\\n\\nAfter the Budget 2018 has amended the law to tax such gains made more\\n\\nthan Rs 1 lakh at 10%, the government has also notified that any losses\\n\\narising from such listed equity shares, mutual funds, etc., would be carried\\n\\nforward.\\n\\nLong-term capital loss from a transfer made on or after 1 April 2018 will be\\n\\nallowed to be set off and carried forward in accordance with existing\\n\\nprovisions of the Act. Therefore, the long-term capital loss can be set off\\n\\nagainst any other long-term capital gain. Please note that you cannot set off\\n\\nlong-term capital loss against short-term capital gains.\\n\\nAlso, any unabsorbed long-term capital loss can be carried forward to the\\n\\nsubsequent eight years for set-off against long-term gains. To set off and carry\\n\\nforward these losses, a person has to file the return within the due date.\\n\\nExample: An equity share is acquired @ Rs.100 on 1st January 2017, its FMV\\n\\nis Rs.200 on 31st January 2018 and it is sold on 1st of April 2023 @ Rs.50.\\n\\nIn this case, the actual cost is less than the FMV as on 31st January 2018.\\n\\nThe sale value is also less than the FMV as on 31st January 2018. Therefore,\\n\\nthe actual cost of Rs.100 will be taken as the cost of acquisition in this case.\\n\\nHence, the long term capital loss will be Rs. 50(Rs.50-Rs.100) in this case.\\n\\nSecurities Transaction Tax (STT)\\n\\nSTT is applicable on all equity shares sold or bought on a stock exchange.\\n\\nThe above tax implications are only applicable to shares listed on a stock\\n\\nexchange. Any sale/purchase on a stock exchange is subject to STT.\\n\\nTherefore, these tax implications discussed above are only for shares on\\n\\nwhich STT is paid.\\n\\nExpenses incurred during the sale of shares:\\n\\nRegistration charges, brokerage charges & various other charges are\\n\\ndeducted from the sale of shares to arrive at the net gain or loss arising from\\n\\ntransfer of such shares.\\n\\nGrandfathering clause\\n\\nA grandfathering clause is a provision that states that an old rule will continue\\n\\nto apply to some existing instances while a new rule will apply to all future\\n\\ncases. Individuals who are not subject to the new rule are said to have\\n\\ngrandfather rights, acquired rights, or have been grandfathered in.\\n\\nLong-term capital gains (LTCG) on the transfer of listed equity shares and\\n\\nequity-oriented mutual fund schemes were tax-free until the 2017-18 fiscal\\n\\nyear.\\n\\nThe Finance Act, 2018 reinstated the LTCG tax on the sale of listed shares\\n\\nand equity-oriented mutual fund schemes with effect from April 1, 2018, i.e.\\n\\nthe fiscal year 2018-19, with a grandfathering clause.\\n\\nWhile the LTCG was reintroduced on 1st February 2018, the CBDT (Central\\n\\nBoard of Direct Taxes) grandfathered gains up to 31st January 2018, i.e. no\\n\\ntax would be paid on gains accrued until 31st January 2018.\\n\\nGrandfathering Clause Formula\\n\\nThe acquisition cost is calculated as follows:\\n\\nValue I is the fair market value (FMV) as of January 31, 2018, or\\n\\nthe actual selling price, whichever is lower.\\n\\nValue II equals Value I or the actual purchase price, whichever is\\n\\ngreater.\\n\\nLong-Term Capital Gain = Sales Value - Acquisition Cost (as calculated\\n\\nabove)\\n\\nTax responsibility = In a year, LTCG of Rs 1 lakh is tax-free. Thus, after\\n\\nsubtracting Rs 1 lakh from the total tax gain, the tax burden will be 10% (plus\\n\\napplicable surcharge and cess).\\n\\nShare Sale as Business Income\\n\\nCertain taxpayers treat gains or losses from the sale of shares as ‘income\\n\\nfrom a business, while others treat it as ‘Capital gains’. Whether your\\n\\ngains/losses from the sale of shares should be treated as business income or\\n\\nbe taxed under capital gains has been a matter of much debate.\\n\\nIn case of significant share trading activity (e.g. if you are a day trader with\\n\\nlots of activity or regularly trade in Futures and Options), your income is\\n\\nusually classified as income from the business. In such a case, you are\\n\\nrequired to file an ITR-3, and your income from share trading is shown under\\n\\n‘income from business & profession’.\\n\\nCalculation of Income From Business\\n\\nWhen you treat the sale of shares as business income, you can reduce\\n\\nexpenses incurred in earning such business income. In such cases, the profits\\n\\nwould be added to your total income for the financial year and, consequently,\\n\\ncharged at tax slab rates.\\n\\nCalculation of Income From Capital Gains\\n\\nIf you treat your income as capital gains, expenses incurred on such transfer\\n\\nare allowed for deduction. Also, long-term gains from equity above Rs 1 lakh\\n\\nannually are taxable at 10%, while short-term gains are taxed at 15%.\\n\\nWhat should be classified as significant share trading activity though it has led\\n\\nto uncertainty and a lot of litigation? Taxpayers receive notices from the tax\\n\\ndepartment and spend a lot of time and energy explaining why they chose a\\n\\nparticular tax treatment for the sale of shares.\\n\\nNew Clarification from CBDT\\n\\nTaxpayers have now been offered a choice of how they want to treat such\\n\\nincome. Once they choose, they must, however, continue the same method in\\n\\nsubsequent years, too, unless there is a major change in the circumstances of\\n\\nthe case. Note that the choice has been made applicable only to listed shares\\n\\nor securities.\\n\\nTo reduce litigation in such matters, CBDT has issued the following\\n\\ninstructions (CBDT circular no 6/2016 dated 29th February 2016)– If the\\n\\ntaxpayer himself opts to treat his listed shares as stock-in-trade, the income\\n\\nshall be treated as business income. Irrespective of the period of holding of\\n\\nlisted shares. The AO shall accept this stand chosen by the taxpayer.\\n\\nIf the taxpayer opts to treat the income as capital gains, the AO shall not put it\\n\\nto dispute. This is applicable for listed shares held for more than 12 months.\\n\\nHowever, this stand, once taken by a taxpayer in a particular assessment\\n\\nyear, shall also be applicable in subsequent assessment years. And the\\n\\ntaxpayer will not be allowed to take a different stand in subsequent years.\\n\\nIn all other cases, the nature of the transaction (whether capital gains or\\n\\nbusiness income) shall continue to be decided basis the concept of ‘significant\\n\\ntrading activity’ and the intention of the taxpayer to hold shares as ‘stock’ or as\\n\\n‘investment’. The above guidance would prevent unnecessary questioning\\n\\nfrom Assessing Officers regarding income classification.\\n\\nHow to Treat the Sale of Unlisted Shares in This Context\\n\\nHowever, in the case of the sale of unlisted shares for which no formal market\\n\\nexists for trading, the department has given its view. Income arising from the\\n\\ntransfer of unlisted shares would be taxed under the head ‘Capital Gain’,\\n\\nirrespective of the holding period, to avoid disputes/litigation and maintain a\\n\\nuniform approach (as per CBDT circular Folio No.225/12/2016/ITA.1I dated\\n\\nthe 2nd of May, 2016).\\n\\nFrequently Asked Questions What is the exemption limit on LTCG on equity shares? Rs.1,00,000 is the exemption limit for LTCG on equity shares provided\\n\\nSTT(securities transaction tax) is paid at the time of both purchase or transfer.\\n\\nWhat is indexation in the context of capital gain? Indexation is the technique used to determine the inflated prices using the\\n\\nprice index. Indexed price helps in adjusting the purchase price of the asset\\n\\nagainst the inflationary rise in the value of the asset. It considerably reduces\\n\\nthe profits thereby reducing the tax liability.\\n\\nRead more here\\n\\nHow are income from futures & options taxed? Income from futures & options are taxed as business income under the head\\n\\nProfits & gains from Business & Profession as they are classified as\\n\\nnon-speculative business income.\\n\\nWhat is the tax treatment for gains accrued upto 31.03.2018? No tax will be levied on the long-term gains on shares accrued upto\\n\\n31.03.2018. However, the long-term gains on transfer of shares exceeding\\n\\nRs.1,00,000 on or after 31.03.2018 will be taxed at 10%.\\n\\nWhat will be the rate of tax on short term capital gains on transfer of equity shares? The rate of tax on short-term capital gains on transfer of equity shares is 15%.\\n\\nIs the Long-term capital loss allowed to be set-off against the short-term capital gain? No. Long-term capital losses cannot be set-off against short-term capital\\n\\ngains. However, the losses can be carried forward to the subsequent eight\\n\\nyears to set-off against long-term capital gains.\\n\\n12. Capital Gains Tax\\n\\nWhat is Capital Gains Tax In India: Types, Tax Rates, Calculation, Exemptions & Tax Saving\\n\\nWhat is Capital Gains Tax In India?\\n\\nAny profit or gain that arises from the sale of a ‘capital asset’ is known as\\n\\n‘income from capital gains’. Such capital gains are taxable in the year in which\\n\\nthe transfer of the capital asset takes place. This is called capital gains tax.\\n\\nThere are two types of Capital Gains: short-term capital gains (STCG) and\\n\\nlong-term capital gains(LTCG).\\n\\nInvestment in a house property is one of the most sought out investments\\n\\nprimarily because you get to own a house. While others may invest with the\\n\\nintention of earning a profit upon selling the property in the future. It is\\n\\nimportant to note that a house property is regarded as a capital asset for\\n\\nincome tax purposes. Consequently, any gain or loss incurred from the sale of\\n\\na house property may be subject to tax under the \\'Capital Gains\\' head.\\n\\nSimilarly, capital gains or losses may arise from sale of different types of\\n\\ncapital assets. We will delve into the chapter on ‘Capital gains’ in detail here.\\n\\nDefining Capital Assets\\n\\nLand, building, house property, vehicles, patents, trademarks, leasehold\\n\\nrights, machinery, and jewellery are a few examples of capital assets. This\\n\\nincludes having rights in or in relation to an Indian company. It also includes\\n\\nthe rights of management or control or any other legal right.\\n\\nThe following do not come under the category of capital asset:\\n\\na. Any stock, consumables or raw material, held for the purpose of business\\n\\nor profession\\n\\nb. Personal goods such as clothes and furniture held for personal use\\n\\nc. Agricultural land in rural(*) India\\n\\nd. 6½% gold bonds (1977) or 7% gold bonds (1980) or National Defence gold\\n\\nbonds (1980) issued by the central government\\n\\ne. Special bearer bonds (1991)\\n\\nf. Gold deposit bond issued under the gold deposit scheme (1999) or deposit\\n\\ncertificates issued under the Gold Monetisation Scheme, 2015 and Gold\\n\\nMonetisation Scheme, 2019 notified by the Central Government.\\n\\nDefinition of rural area (effective from AY 2014-15) – Any area which is\\n\\noutside the jurisdiction of a municipality or cantonment board, having a\\n\\npopulation of 10,000 or more is considered a rural area. Also, it should not fall\\n\\nwithin a distance given below\\n\\nDistance\\n\\nPopulation\\n\\n(to be measured aerially)\\n\\n(as per the last census).\\n\\n2 kms from local limit of\\n\\nIf the population of the municipality/cantonment\\n\\nmunicipality or cantonment\\n\\nboard is more than 10,000 but not more than 1\\n\\nboard\\n\\nlakh\\n\\n6 kms from local limit of\\n\\nIf the population of the municipality/cantonment\\n\\nmunicipality or cantonment\\n\\nboard is more than 1 lakh but not more than 10\\n\\nboard\\n\\nlakh\\n\\n8 kms from local limit of\\n\\nIf the population of the municipality/cantonment\\n\\nmunicipality or cantonment\\n\\nboard is more than 10 lakh\\n\\nboard\\n\\nTypes of Capital Assets?\\n\\n1. STCA ( Short-term capital asset ) An asset held for a period of 36 months\\n\\nor less is a short-term capital asset.\\n\\nThe criteria is 24 months for unlisted shares (those shares which are not listed\\n\\nin a recognized stock exchange in India) and immovable properties such as\\n\\nland, building and house property from FY 2017-18. For instance, if you sell\\n\\nhouse property after holding it for a period of 24 months, any income arising\\n\\nwill be treated as a long-term capital gain, provided that property is sold after\\n\\n31st March 2017.\\n\\nThe reduced period of the aforementioned 24 months is not applicable to\\n\\nmovable property such as jewellery, debt-oriented mutual funds etc.\\n\\nSome assets are considered short-term capital assets when these are held for\\n\\n12 months or less. This rule is applicable if the date of transfer is after 10th\\n\\nJuly 2014 (irrespective of what the date of purchase is). These assets are:\\n\\nEquity or preference shares in a company listed on a recognized\\n\\nstock exchange in India\\n\\nSecurities (like debentures, bonds, govt securities etc.) listed on a\\n\\nrecognized stock exchange in India\\n\\nUnits of UTI, whether quoted or not\\n\\nUnits of equity oriented mutual fund, whether quoted or not\\n\\nZero coupon bonds, whether quoted or not\\n\\n2. LTCA ( Long-term capital asset ): An asset held for more than 36 months is\\n\\na long-term capital asset. They will be classified as a long-term capital asset if\\n\\nheld for more than 36 months as earlier.\\n\\nCapital assets such as land, building and house property shall be considered\\n\\nas long-term capital asset if the owner holds it for a period of 24 months or\\n\\nmore (from FY 2017-18).\\n\\nWhereas, below-listed assets if held for a period of more than 12 months,\\n\\nshall be considered as long-term capital asset.\\n\\nEquity or preference shares in a company listed on a recognized\\n\\nstock exchange in India\\n\\nSecurities (like debentures, bonds, govt securities etc.) listed on a\\n\\nrecognized stock exchange in India\\n\\nUnits of UTI, whether quoted or not\\n\\nUnits of equity oriented mutual fund, whether quoted or not\\n\\nZero coupon bonds, whether quoted or not\\n\\nClassification of Inherited Capital Asset\\n\\nIn case an asset is acquired by gift, will, succession or inheritance, the period\\n\\nfor which the asset was held by the previous owner is also included when\\n\\ndetermining whether it’s a short term or a long-term capital asset. In the case\\n\\nof bonus shares or rights shares, the period of holding is counted from the\\n\\ndate of allotment of bonus shares or rights shares respectively.\\n\\nTax Rates – Long-Term Capital Gains and Short-Term Capital Gains\\n\\nTax Type\\n\\nLong-term capital\\n\\ngains tax (LTCG)\\n\\nCondition\\n\\nSale of:\\n\\nListed Equity shares (If STT has\\n\\nbeen paid on purchase and sale of\\n\\nsuch shares)\\n\\nunits of equity oriented mutual\\n\\nfund (If STT has been paid on sale\\n\\nof such units)\\n\\nOthers\\n\\nApplicable Tax\\n\\n10% over and\\n\\nabove Rs 1 lakh\\n\\n20%\\n\\nShort-term capital\\n\\nWhen Securities Transaction Tax\\n\\nNormal slab rates\\n\\ngains tax (STCG)\\n\\n(STT) is not applicable\\n\\nWhen STT is applicable\\n\\n15%.\\n\\nTax on Equity and Debt Mutual Funds\\n\\nGains made on the sale of debt funds and equity funds are treated differently.\\n\\nAny fund that invests heavily in equities (more than 65% of their total portfolio)\\n\\nis called an equity fund.\\n\\nFunds\\n\\nOn or before 1 April 2023\\n\\nEffective 1 April 2023\\n\\nDebt\\n\\nFunds\\n\\nShort-Term\\n\\nGains\\n\\nAt tax slab\\n\\nrates of the\\n\\nindividual\\n\\nLong-Term Gains\\n\\n10% without\\n\\nindexation or 20%\\n\\nwith indexation\\n\\nwhichever is\\n\\nlower\\n\\nShort-Term\\n\\nGains\\n\\nAt tax slab\\n\\nrates of the\\n\\nindividual\\n\\nLong-Term\\n\\nGains\\n\\nAt tax slab\\n\\nrates of the\\n\\nindividual\\n\\nEquity\\n\\n15%\\n\\n10% over and\\n\\n15%\\n\\n10% over and\\n\\nFunds\\n\\nabove Rs 1 lakh\\n\\nabove Rs 1\\n\\nwithout indexation\\n\\nlakh without\\n\\nindexation\\n\\nTax Rules for Debt Mutual Funds\\n\\nRecently in amendment to Finance Bill 2023, gains from debt mutual funds\\n\\nwill now be taxed at slab rates and they will be considered as short-term\\n\\nirrespective of the holding period. Which means you will lose out the\\n\\nindexation benefit. Prior to 1st April 2023, debt mutual funds had to be held for\\n\\nmore than 36 months to qualify as a long-term capital asset. It means you\\n\\nneed to remain invested in these funds for at least three years to get the\\n\\nbenefit of long-term capital gains tax.

Capital gains is determined by reducing the purchase price from the sale\\n\\nprice. However, for an asset that has been held for a long time, it would not be\\n\\nappropriate to determine gains by merely reducing purchase price from sale\\n\\nprice without giving any effect to the inflation. Hence, the concept of indexing\\n\\nthe purchase price has been brought in. This way, the indexed purchase price\\n\\ncan be reduced from sale price to determine gains. So, indexation applies\\n\\nonly to assets held for long-term.\\n\\nShould an NRI pay taxes on gains made on the sale of property in India? Property sold in India is generally subject to tax deduction. The person buying\\n\\nthe property must deduct taxes at the rate applicable to the NRI’s income\\n\\nslab, if the property is a short-term asset. If the property is a long-term asset,\\n\\n20% LTCG tax is charged. Further, it is important for the NRI to ensure that\\n\\ntaxes are deducted on the gains made and not on the sale proceeds.

Such contracts are not\\n\\nspeculative in nature.\\n\\nHedging contract in respect of stocks and shares\\n\\nTo guard against loss due to price fluctuations in stocks and shares a hedge\\n\\ncontract entered into by a dealer or investor is not considered as speculative.\\n\\nForward contract\\n\\nThis is a contract entered into by a member of a forward market or stock\\n\\nexchange in the course of any transaction in the nature of jobbing (all\\n\\ntransactions are squared off during the same day) or arbitrage (purchase of\\n\\ncommodity or security in one market for immediate sale in another market) to\\n\\nguard against loss which may arise in the ordinary course of his business as\\n\\nsuch member. A forward market is an over-the-counter marketplace that sets\\n\\nthe price of a financial instrument or asset for future delivery.\\n\\nTrading in derivatives\\n\\nAn eligible transaction (carried out electronically on screen-based systems\\n\\nthrough a recognized broker as per relevant statutes and which is supported\\n\\nby a time stamped contract note indicating unique client identity number and\\n\\nPAN) in respect of trading in derivatives referred to in Securities Contracts\\n\\n(Regulation) Act, 1956 and carried out in a recognised stock exchange is\\n\\nknown as trading in derivatives.\\n\\nTrading in commodity derivatives\\n\\nIt is an eligible transaction (carried out electronically on screen-based systems\\n\\nthrough registered member or intermediary as per relevant statutes and which\\n\\nis supported by a time stamped contract note indicating unique client identity\\n\\nnumber, unique trade number and PAN) in respect of trading in commodity\\n\\nderivatives carried out in a recognised association, which is chargeable to\\n\\ncommodities transaction tax under Chapter VII of the Finance Act, 2013.\\n\\nHow is Income or Loss from Speculative Business Treated?\\n\\nSpeculative business to be treated as distinct business\\n\\nIf a taxpayer is carrying out many businesses along with a speculative\\n\\nbusiness, such speculative business of a taxpayer must be deemed as distinct\\n\\nand separate from any other business carried out by him.\\n\\nTreatment of loss from speculative business\\n\\nLosses from speculative business can be set off only against profits from\\n\\nspeculative business. If the loss could not be set-off during in that year, it can\\n\\nbe carried forward to the next 4 assessment years and set-off only against the\\n\\nspeculative income. Further, if depreciation and capital expenditure incurred\\n\\non scientific research, if any, relates to speculative business then such\\n\\ndepreciation/capital expenditure shall be set-off first.\\n\\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\\n\\nHow do you calculate turnover for speculative business?\\n\\nIn case of speculation business, the aggregate of both positive and negative\\n\\ndifferences is to be considered as the turnover.\\n\\nHow is speculative income taxed?\\n\\nIntra-day trading is deemed speculative business transactions under Section\\n\\n43(5) of the money Tax Act of 1961, and the money derived from it is either\\n\\nspeculation gains or speculation losses. Profits from speculating are taxed at\\n\\nregular rates.\\n\\nWhat is speculative trading?\\n\\nSpeculation is the act of trading an asset or undertaking a financial transaction\\n\\nin which there is a large danger of losing most or all of the initial investment\\n\\nwith the intention of making a significant profit. It entails trading in high-risk\\n\\nfinancial products with the prospect of large rewards. The goal is to profit as\\n\\nmuch as possible from market swings.\\n\\nWhich ITR is Used for Speculative Income?\\n\\nGenerally ITR-3 is filed for reporting speculative business income or loss\\n\\nsimilar to that of normal business income.\\n\\nWhat is LTCG?\\n\\nThe assets owned by an individual that may or may not be connected\\n\\nwith business or profession are called capital assets. The common\\n\\nexamples of capital assets include bonds, mutual funds, jewellery,\\n\\npatents, or trademarks. However, furniture and clothes for personal\\n\\nuse, rural agricultural land are not capital assets.\\n\\nThe LTCG or long-term capital gains tax is charged on the profit\\n\\ngenerated from an asset such as shares, bonds, commodities, or real\\n\\nestate that is held for the long-term. The period of holding, which is\\n\\n‘short term’ or ‘long term’ differs across various assets. It is defined as\\n\\nper the Income Tax Act, 1961.\\n\\nThe table below shows you how the capital assets are classified as\\n\\nshort-term or long-term based on the holding period.\\n\\nCapital Asset\\n\\nHolding period of the capital asset\\n\\nImmovable Property such as House\\n\\nProperty\\n\\nMovable Property such as Gold\\n\\nJewelry\\n\\nListed Shares\\n\\nShort Term\\n\\nLess than two\\n\\nyears\\n\\nLess than three\\n\\nyears\\n\\nLess than one\\n\\nyear\\n\\nLong Term\\n\\nTwo years or\\n\\nmore\\n\\nThree years or\\n\\nmore\\n\\nOne year or\\n\\nmore\\n\\nEquity-oriented mutual funds\\n\\nLess than one\\n\\nOne year or\\n\\nyear\\n\\nmore\\n\\nDebt-oriented mutual funds\\n\\nLess than three\\n\\nThree years or\\n\\nyears\\n\\nmore\\n\\nLong-term capital gains tax is levied on the capital gains from\\n\\nshares and equity-oriented mutual funds, that are held for one year\\n\\nor more.\\n\\nThe long-term capital gains tax is charged at the rate of 10%, on\\n\\nthe gains above Rs 1 lakh in a financial year. Short-term capital\\n\\ngains tax is charged at the rate of 15%.\\n\\nWhat is an LTCG Calculator (Long Term Capital Gains Tax Calculator)?\\n\\nThe long-term capital gains or LTCG Calculator is a utility tool, which\\n\\nshows you the long-term capital gains and the LTCG tax liability, for\\n\\nequity-oriented mutual funds and listed equity shares.\\n\\nThe LTCG Calculator consists of a formula box, where you enter the\\n\\nholding period, the purchase value, and the sale value of the\\n\\nequity-oriented fund. The calculator will display the taxable short-term\\n\\ncapital gain or long-term capital gain, depending on the holding period.\\n\\nHow Does LTCG Calculators Work?\\n\\nYou can understand the working of an LTCG calculator with this\\n\\nexample. You purchased 200 shares of XYZ Company Ltd at Rs 1,000\\n\\nper share in May 2018. You sold all the 200 shares at Rs 1,800 per\\n\\nshare in January 2020.\\n\\nYou have held the shares for more than one year. The profit of Rs\\n\\n1,60,000 (200*1800 – 200*1000) is called long-term capital gains.\\n\\nYou have to pay the long-term capital gains tax on the gains that are\\n\\nabove Rs 1 lakh in a financial year. You have the LTCG tax on Rs\\n\\n60,000. (Rs 1,60,000 – Rs 1,00,000) at 10%. You pay a long-term\\n\\ncapital gains tax of Rs 6,000. (Rs 60,000@10%).\\n\\nSuppose you sold the 200 shares in January 2019 when the share\\n\\nprice was Rs 1,500 per share. The total purchase value of your 200\\n\\nshares in May 2018 was Rs 2,00,000. You have held the shares for\\n\\nless than one year. The profit of Rs 1,00,000 (200*1500 – 200*1000)\\n\\nis called short-term capital gains.\\n\\nYou must pay short-term capital gains tax at 15% on the short-term\\n\\ncapital gains which is Rs 1,00,000 *15% = Rs 15,000.\\n\\nThe announcement for the introduction of the long-term capital gains\\n\\ntax on equity-oriented instruments and shares was made during the\\n\\nUnion Budget 2018. The new rule was applicable for all the\\n\\ntransactions that are made on or after 01 April 2018.\\n\\nHow to Use the LTCG Calculator?\\n\\nYou must choose the period when you sold the shares or\\n\\nequity-oriented mutual fund units. If you select before 31 March\\n\\n2018, there is no long-term capital gains tax on the investment. If\\n\\nyou choose after 01 April 2018, you will incur a long-term capital\\n\\ngains tax.\\n\\nYou then select the holding period as less than one year if you\\n\\nhave held the investment for the requisite period.\\n\\nYou must enter the sale value and the purchase value of the\\n\\ninvestment.\\n\\nThe LTCG Calculator will show you the short-term capital gain and\\n\\nSTCG taxes.\\n\\nYou must select the holding period as more than one year if you\\n\\nhave invested for this duration.\\n\\nYou then select the sale value of the investment.\\n\\nYou must select the date of purchase of the units as after 31\\n\\nJanuary 2018 or before 31 January 2018 as applicable.\\n\\nIf you select the latter option, the calculator will ask you for the fair\\n\\nmarket value.\\n\\nThe LTCG Calculator will show you the long-term capital gain and\\n\\nLTCG taxes.\\n\\nBenefits of Using the LTCG Calculator?\\n\\nThe LTCG Calculator will show you the long-term capital gains tax\\n\\non the purchase and sale of equity-oriented funds and shares in a\\n\\nmatter of seconds.\\n\\nYou get a birds-eye view of the actual return from the investment\\n\\nafter accounting for the taxes. It helps you to plan the duration of\\n\\nthe investment in equity funds and shares for maximum\\n\\ntax-efficiency.\\n\\nYou can plan the investments in equity instruments as you already\\n\\nknow the short-term or long-term capital gains tax you would incur\\n\\ndepending on the holding period.\\n\\nFrequently Asked Questions\\n\\nWhy does the LTCG Calculator ask you for the date of sale of equity\\n\\nshares or units?\\n\\nThe long-term capital gains on the sale of equity-oriented funds and\\n\\nshares were made taxable during the Union Budget 2018. The rule\\n\\nwould apply for all transactions made on or after 01 April 2018. If you\\n\\nhad invested in equity-oriented securities or shares before 31 January\\n\\n2018, all gains till that date are considered to be grandfathered and\\n\\nexempt from tax.\\n\\nHowever, STCG would continue to be taxed at 15% (excluding\\n\\nsurcharge and cess). Any long-term capital gains above Rs 1 lakh that\\n\\narise from the transfer of equity-oriented mutual funds and shares\\n\\nafter 01 April 2018 are taxed at 10%. The LTCG Calculator considers\\n\\nthis rule and calculates the long-term capital gains tax.\\n\\nWhy does the LTCG Calculator ask for the holding period between the\\n\\ndate of purchase and sale of equity units?\\n\\nThe LTCG Calculator asks you to select the holding period as less\\n\\nthan one year or one year or more. If you choose the option as less\\n\\nthan one year, the calculator will show you the short-term capital gains\\n\\ntax on the investment. If you select the latter option, the calculator\\n\\ndisplays the long-term capital gains tax on the asset.\\n\\nWhy does LTCG Calculator ask you to fill the FMV (Fair Market\\n\\nValue)?\\n\\nTo make sure that only the gains after 01 February 2018 are\\n\\nconsidered for taxation, the government introduced a grandfathering\\n\\nclause. You must calculate the cost of acquisition as per the formula\\n\\nshown below:\\n\\nThe cost of acquisition of the asset is the higher of:\\n\\na) The actual cost at which the asset is acquired.\\n\\nb) The lower of the fair market value as of 31 January 2018 and the\\n\\ntotal amount you receive when selling the equity-oriented fund or\\n\\nshare.\\n\\nLet us understand the calculation of long-term capital gains for\\n\\ndifferent scenarios:\\n\\nExample 1: You have purchased an equity share on 01 February 2017\\n\\nat Rs 150. The fair market value as of 31 January 2018 was Rs 250.\\n\\nYou sold the share on 01 May 2018 at Rs 300.\\n\\nThe actual cost of acquisition at Rs 150 is lower as compared to the\\n\\nfair market value (FMV) on 31 January 2018. The FMV of Rs 250 is\\n\\ntaken as the cost of acquisition. The long-term capital gains tax will be\\n\\nthe difference between the selling price of the asset and the fair\\n\\nmarket value, which is Rs 50 (Rs 300 – Rs 250).\\n\\nExample 2: You have purchased an equity share on 01 February 2017\\n\\nat Rs 200. The fair market value as of 31 January 2018 was Rs 150.\\n\\nYou sold the share on 01 May 2018 at Rs 300.\\n\\nThe fair market value on 31 January 2018 at Rs 150 is lower as\\n\\ncompared to the actual cost of the acquisition at Rs 200. The actual\\n\\ncost of Rs 200 will be taken as the actual cost of the purchase. The\\n\\nlong-term capital gain will be the difference between the selling price\\n\\nof the asset and the actual cost of the acquisition, which is Rs 100 (Rs\\n\\n300 – Rs 200).\\n\\nExample 3: You have purchased an equity share on 01 February 2017\\n\\nat Rs 200. The fair market value as of 31 January 2018 was Rs 250.\\n\\nYou sold the share on 01 May 2018 at Rs 100.\\n\\nIn this example, the actual cost of acquisition at Rs 200 is lower as\\n\\ncompared to the fair market value as of 31 January 2018 at Rs 250.\\n\\nThe sale value of the asset at Rs 100 is also lower as compared to the\\n\\nfair market value of Rs 250 and the cost of the acquisition at Rs 200.\\n\\nThe actual cost of acquisition of Rs 200 is taken as the cost of the\\n\\nacquisition. The long-term capital loss is Rs 100 (Rs 100 – Rs 200) for\\n\\nthis scenario.\\n\\nWhat is the concept of Grandfathering in Income Tax?\\n\\nWhen a new clause or policy is added to a law, certain persons may\\n\\nbe relieved from complying with the new clause. This is called\\n\\n“grandfathering”. “Grandfathered” persons enjoy the right to avail the\\n\\nconcession because they have made their decisions under the old\\n\\nlaw.\\n\\nSecurities Transaction Tax (STT)- Features, Tax Rate & Applicability\\n\\nIt is quite common for taxpayers to resort to tax-evading measures to save\\n\\ntheir tax outflow to the Government. It is necessary for the Government to\\n\\nkeep a tab on such measures by having provisions in the law or introducing\\n\\nnew provisions / modifying the existing ones in order to curb this practice.\\n\\nWhen people started evading capital gains tax by not declaring their profits on\\n\\nthe sale of stocks, the Finance Act, way back in 2004, introduced a tax called\\n\\nthe Securities Transaction Tax (STT) as a clean and efficient way of collecting\\n\\ntaxes from financial market transactions.\\n\\nWhat is Securities Transaction Tax (STT)?\\n\\nSTT is a kind of financial transaction tax which is similar to tax collected at\\n\\nsource (TCS). STT is a direct tax levied on every purchase and sale of\\n\\nsecurities that are listed on the recognised stock exchanges in India. STT is\\n\\ngoverned by the Securities Transaction Tax Act (STT Act), and the STT Act\\n\\nhas specifically listed down various taxable securities transactions i.e.,\\n\\ntransactions on which STT is leviable.\\n\\nTaxable securities include equity, derivatives, and unit of equity-oriented\\n\\nmutual fund. It also includes unlisted shares sold under an offer for sale to the\\n\\npublic included in IPO and where such shares are subsequently listed in stock\\n\\nexchanges. STT is an amount to be paid over and above transaction value\\n\\nand hence, increases transaction value.\\n\\nAs already mentioned, STT is leviable on taxable securities transactions. STT\\n\\nAct has also provided the value of the transactions on which STT is required\\n\\nto be paid and person who is responsible for paying STT i.e., either buyer or\\n\\nseller. However, rate of STT will be decided by Government and modified from\\n\\ntime to time if necessary.\\n\\nProvisions of collection of STT works similar to TCS or TDS. STT is required\\n\\nto be collected by a recognised stock exchange or by the prescribed person in\\n\\nthe case of every mutual fund or the lead merchant banker in the case of an\\n\\ninitial public offer, as the case may be, and subsequently payable to the\\n\\nGovernment on or before the 7th of the following month. In case the above\\n\\npersons fail to collect the taxes, they are still obliged the discharge an\\n\\nequivalent amount of tax to the credit of the Central Government within the 7th\\n\\nof the following month. Further, failure to collect or remit whatever has been\\n\\ncollected will result in a levy of interest and penal consequences too.\\n\\nFeatures of Securities Transaction Tax\\n\\nSTT is a straightforward direct tax that is simple to compute and impose.\\n\\nSome of STT\\'s most distinguishing characteristics are given below.\\n\\n1. An STT charge is applied on all sell transactions for options and futures.\\n\\n2. For the purposes of STT computation, each ‘futures’ trade is valued at the\\n\\nactual traded price, whereas each option trade is valued at the premium.\\n\\n3. The amount of STT that a clearing member must pay is the aggregate of all\\n\\nSTT taxes owed by trading members under him.\\n\\nSecurities on which STT is Applicable\\n\\nWhile the term ‘securities’ is not defined under the STT Act, the STT Act\\n\\nspecifically allows borrowing of the definition of such terms not defined in the\\n\\nSTT Act but defined in the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956 or\\n\\nIncome-tax Act, 1961. The term ‘Securities’ is defined in the Securities\\n\\nContracts (Regulation) Act and includes the following:\\n\\nShares, scrips, stocks, bonds, debentures, debenture stock or\\n\\nother marketable securities of a like nature in or of any\\n\\nincorporated company or other body corporates.\\n\\nDerivatives.\\n\\nUnits or any other instrument issued by any collective investment\\n\\nscheme to the investors in such schemes.\\n\\nGovernment securities of equity nature.\\n\\nEquity-oriented units of mutual funds.\\n\\nRights or interest in securities.\\n\\nSecuritised debt instruments.\\n\\nHence, securities include all of the above and are traded on the recognized\\n\\nstock exchange for the purpose of STT levy.

These transactions, as given in the table above, are\\n\\nsubject to an STT levy of 0.001 per cent. However, SEBI had in its Circular\\n\\ndated 11.4.2018 listed around 46 stocks, in respect of which derivative\\n\\ncontracts would be settled by way of physical delivery of shares as against\\n\\ncash. However, no clarity emerged on the rate of STT that would apply to\\n\\nthese kinds of transactions.\\n\\nFurther, for such transactions, the stock exchanges began to levy an STT of\\n\\n0.1 per cent (this is the rate of STT for delivery-based equity share\\n\\ntransactions), which is almost 10 times what is levied for derivative contracts\\n\\nsettled in cash. Hence, a petition was lodged by the Association of National\\n\\nExchange Members of India (ANMI) against the stock exchanges before the\\n\\nBombay High Court to address the aforementioned concern of a levy of 0.1\\n\\nper cent of STT on physical delivery of derivatives.\\n\\nThe High Court has sought the comments of the Central Board of Direct Taxes\\n\\n(CBDT) in this regard. The CBDT, in response, has issued a clarification dated\\n\\n27 August 2018, where it has observed that where a derivative contract is\\n\\nbeing settled by physical delivery of shares, such transaction would be similar\\n\\nto a transaction in equity shares where the contract is settled by actual\\n\\ndelivery of shares. Therefore, the STT rate as applicable to delivery-based\\n\\nequity transactions would apply to such derivative transactions too.\\n\\nSecurities Transaction Tax and Income Tax\\n\\nTax on Capital Gains\\n\\nWhen the STT levy was introduced in 2004, a new Section 10(38) was\\n\\nintroduced to benefit taxpayers who would incur STT. As per income tax law,\\n\\nfor transactions undertaken until 31 March 2018, any capital gain on the sale\\n\\nof shares or equity-oriented mutual fund units (EOMF) which are subject to\\n\\nSTT is taxed at beneficial/Nil rate.\\n\\nWhile long-term capital gains (if shares or EOMF are held for > 12 months)\\n\\nare exempt from tax, short-term capital gains on such securities are taxed at a\\n\\nconcessional rate of 15%. However, in order to prevent abuse of exemption\\n\\nprovisions by certain persons for declaring their unaccounted income as\\n\\nexempt long-term capital gains by entering into sham transactions, the\\n\\nFinance Budget 2018 proposed to withdraw the exemption on long-term\\n\\ncapital gain and tax long-term capital gains on equity shares and EOMF at\\n\\nconcessional rate of 10% with respect to transfer effected on or after 1 April\\n\\n2018.\\n\\nHowever, gains accrued till 31 January 2018 are grandfathered, i.e., in case of\\n\\ntransfers up to 31 January 2018, the cost of acquisition of shares or EOMF\\n\\nacquired before 1 February 2018 will be replaced by fair market value as of\\n\\n31st January 2018.\\n\\nTax on Business Income\\n\\nIf a person is trading in securities and offering income/loss from such trading\\n\\nas business income, STT paid is allowed to be deducted as business\\n\\nexpense.\\n\\nWhen Is Securities Transaction Tax Levied?\\n\\nEach purchase and sale of shares listed on a domestic and recognised stock\\n\\nmarket is subject to a securities transaction tax. The government determines\\n\\nthe taxation rate. Under the STT act, all stock market transactions involving\\n\\nequities or equity derivatives such as futures and options are subject to\\n\\ntaxation. When a share transaction is completed, STT is levied. As a result,\\n\\nSTT is quick, transparent, and effective. Because the tax is imposed as soon\\n\\nas the transaction occurs, incidents of non-payment, incorrect payment, and\\n\\nso on are minimised to a bare minimum. However, the net effect is that it\\n\\nraises the cost of the transactions.\\n\\nSTT Example\\n\\nAssume a dealer purchases 500 shares worth Rs.10,000 at Rs.20 per share\\n\\nand sells them at Rs.30 per share. If the trader sells the shares on the same\\n\\nday, the intraday STT rate of 0.025% will apply.\\n\\nAs a result, STT = 0.025*30*500 = Rs.375.\\n\\nSimilarly, the appropriate STT for futures and options is 0.01%. If a trader\\n\\nbuys 5 lots of Nifty futures at Rs.5,000 and sells them at Rs.5,010, the STT is\\n\\ncalculated as follows:\\n\\nSTT = 0.01*5010*50*5 = Rs.125.25\\n\\nFrequently Asked Questions\\n\\nIs STT a direct or indirect tax?\\n\\nThe Securities Transaction Tax (STT) is a direct tax levied on all purchases &\\n\\nsells of equity securities on India\\'s regulated stock exchanges.\\n\\nWhat is the tax rate on shares on which STT is levied ?\\n\\nWhere the holding period is less than 1 year such transaction is considered as\\n\\nshort term and tax @ 15% will be levied.\\n\\nWhere the holding period is more than 1 year such transaction is considered\\n\\nas long term and tax @ 10% will be levied.\\n\\nAbove special rates are applicable only if STT was paid at the time of\\n\\npurchase and sale of such security.\\n\\nHow can I avoid STT charges?\\n\\nNo matter what, if you purchase and sell shares or mutual fund units STT is\\n\\ncharged.\\n\\nWhich fund is exempt from STT?\\n\\nThere will be no STT charged on the sale of debt fund units.\\n\\nCan we claim STT in capital gain?\\n\\nIndividuals who earn profit from LTCG or STCG, cannot claim STT as an\\n\\nexpense.\\n\\nLong Term Capital Gains (LTCG) on the Sale of Stocks, Shares etc.\\n\\nUpdated on: Mar 13th, 2024\\n\\n|\\n\\n18 min read\\n\\nBudget 2018 proposed to remove Section 10 (38) of the Income Tax Act 1961.\\n\\nAs per this section, the long-term capital gains (LTCG) arising on the sale of\\n\\nequity shares or units of an equity-oriented mutual fund on which Securities\\n\\nTransaction Tax (STT) is paid were exempt from taxation.\\n\\nWhat is Section 112A?\\n\\nSection 112A allows long-term capital gains on the sale of listed equity\\n\\nshares, equity-oriented mutual funds, and business trust units to be taxed.\\n\\nFollowing the abolition of the exemption under section 10(38), the said section\\n\\nwas established in Budget 2018. It is effective beginning with the fiscal year\\n\\n2018-19. It provides for a 10% tax on long-term capital gains on listed stocks\\n\\nthat surpass a Rs.1 lakh threshold. The schedule for Section 112A of the\\n\\nIncome Tax Act, which requires the taxpayer to fill out the scrip-wise data of\\n\\nsecurities sold during the year, is included in the income tax form.\\n\\nScope of Section 112A\\n\\nThe following conditions apply for availing the benefit of the concessional rate\\n\\nunder section 112A of the Income-tax Act,1961:\\n\\n1. The securities transaction tax (STT) has been paid on the acquisition and\\n\\ntransfer of an equity share of a corporation.\\n\\n2. The STT was paid when the asset was sold in the case of units of an\\n\\nequity-oriented fund or units of a business trust.\\n\\n3. The securities should be long-term investments.\\n\\n4. No deduction under Chapter VI A is available for such long-term capital\\n\\ngain.\\n\\n5. A rebate under section 87A cannot be claimed in respect of long-term\\n\\ncapital gain tax due under section 112A.\\n\\nApplicability of Section 112A\\n\\nThe provisions of this section will apply from the financial year (FY) 2018-19,\\n\\ni.e. AY 2019-20. This otherwise means any transfer carried out after 1 April\\n\\n2018, resulting in LTCG above Rs 1 lakh, will attract tax at the rate of 10%.\\n\\nGrandfathering Provisions Under Section 112A of Income-tax Act\\n\\nIn the Budget 2018, there has been a proposal to Grandfather investments\\n\\nmade on or before 31 January 2018.\\n\\nWhat is the concept of Grandfathering?\\n\\nWhen a new clause or policy is added to a law, certain persons may be\\n\\nrelieved from complying with the new clause. This is called “grandfathering”.\\n\\n“Grandfathered” persons enjoy the right to avail the concession because they\\n\\nhave made their decisions under the old law.\\n\\nThe concept of grandfathering in the case of LTCG on the sale of equity\\n\\ninvestments works as follows:\\n\\nA method of determining the Cost of Acquisition (COA) of such investments\\n\\nhas been specifically laid down as per the COA of such investments shall be\\n\\ndeemed to be the higher of:\\n\\nThe actual COA of such investments; and\\n\\nThe lower of-\\n\\nFair Market Value (‘FMV’) of such investments; and\\n\\nthe Full Value of Consideration received or accruing as\\n\\na result of the transfer of the capital asset i.e. the Sale\\n\\nPrice\\n\\nFurther, the FMV would be the highest price quoted on the recognized stock\\n\\nexchange on 31 January 2018.\\n\\nIn case there is no trading of the said asset in such stock exchange, the\\n\\nhighest price on a day immediately preceding 31 January 2018 shall be\\n\\nconsidered to be the FMV. In effect, the taxpayer can claim the highest price\\n\\nquoted on the recognised stock exchange on 31 January 2018 as the COA\\n\\nand claim the deduction for the same.\\n\\nThe computation mechanism has been further explained by way of the\\n\\nfollowing examples\\n\\nCapital Gain/ Loss = Sale Price – Revised Cost of Acquisition on 31.1.2018\\n\\nExample 1\\n\\nMr X bought equity shares on 15th Dec 2016 for Rs. 10,000.

Now if such bonus shares are sold after 31st Jan\\n\\n2018, then FMV as of 31st Jan 2018 will be considered as the Cost of\\n\\nacquisition of such shares.\\n\\nCarry Forward of Long-Term Capital Losses (LTCL) on Sale of such Shares\\n\\nIf the net result for any assessment year is a loss, other than a capital gain,\\n\\nthe assessee is entitled to have the amount written off against his income\\n\\nfrom any other source under the same head.\\n\\nA short-term capital loss might be set off against any capital gain in the case\\n\\nof capital losses. As a result, a short-term capital loss can be set off against\\n\\nboth a short-term capital loss and a long-term capital loss. Long-term capital\\n\\nloss, on the other hand, may only be offset against long-term capital gain.\\n\\nLong-term capital gains resulting from the transfer of equity shares listed on a\\n\\nrecognised stock exchange are currently taxed at 10%. If any long-term\\n\\ncapital losses result from the selling of such equity shares, such losses may\\n\\nnow be set off against the other long-term capital gain.\\n\\nFair Market Value\\n\\na. The Fair Market Value (FMV) of a listed security is the highest price quoted\\n\\non a recognised stock market.\\n\\nb. If the security was not traded on 31 January 2018, the FMV is the highest\\n\\nprice quoted on a date immediately before 31 January 2018 when the security\\n\\nwas traded on a recognised stock exchange.\\n\\nc. In the case of unlisted units on January 31, 2018, the net asset value of the\\n\\nunits on that date.\\n\\nd.

Such data is reflected in your AIS - Annual Information\\n\\nStatement.\\n\\nThus it is very important that you reconcile the capital gain statement that you\\n\\nhave with the data available in AIS before you file your ITR. Any Mismatch in\\n\\nITR and AIS will result in a notice from the Income tax department\\n\\nRebate under 87A\\n\\nRebate under Section 87A of the Income Tax Act is allowed on income tax\\n\\ncomputed on all income, excluding the income tax payable on such LTCG.\\n\\nOur Take\\n\\nTo compensate for the shortfall in the GST collection, the government has\\n\\nprobably taken the step of imposing a levy of taxes on shares held for the long\\n\\nterm. This is, of course, over and above the already existing Securities\\n\\nTransaction Tax (STT) which was introduced in the year 2004 to check\\n\\ninstances of capital gains tax evasion.\\n\\nOverall, the levy of both LTCG tax and STT seems quite unfair. The main\\n\\nquestion remains unanswered: “How far this move will contribute to yielding a\\n\\nhigher revenue to the government, which is the underlying objective of this\\n\\nmove?”\\n\\nFrequently Asked Questions\\n\\nI have some equity shares listed on a recognised stock exchange in\\n\\nIndia purchased on 31/1/2020 and sold on 12/1/2023. Will my sale be\\n\\ntaxed?\\n\\nYes, tax will be applicable at 10% of your gains if the gains exceed 1 lakh\\n\\nrupees. And gains will be calculated as shown above.\\n\\nI sold some shares in FY 2023-24 which was purchased in FY\\n\\n2001-02 and have incurred some losses. Can I set off losses?\\n\\nYes you can set off your losses against other Long Term Capital Gains or\\n\\ncarry forward them.\\n\\nAre there any provisions to claim exemption on Long-term capital gain\\n\\ntax on the sale of shares?\\n\\nYes, You can claim exemption under section 54F, where if you reinvest the\\n\\nproceed in residential house property, you will be able to claim exemption.\\n\\nHow do I get a capital gain statement for ITR filing?\\n\\nAll brokerage firms provide capital gain statements or Tax P&Ls which can be\\n\\nused for filing ITR purpose.\\n\\nIs there any free limit / exemption on LTCG ?\\n\\nUpto Rs 1 lakhs there is no tax liability , LTCG exceeding Rs. 1 lakhs will be\\n\\nsubject to 10% tax.\\n\\nIs there any Tax deducted on sale of stock / Mutual Fund?\\n\\nNo, TDS is not applicable on sale of stocks or mutual fund for Tax Resident.\\n\\nResident having capital gain will be to make the tax payment via the mode of\\n\\nadvance tax on voluntary basis\\n\\nHowever for Non Resident TDS will be computed on capital gains (Short term\\n\\nor long term) and deducted.\\n\\nWhat are the expenses deducted from capital gain ?\\n\\nAll expenses incurred like acquisition cost , brokerage charges paid , Stamp\\n\\nduty , SEBI turnover fees , Clearing charges , GST is allowed as deduction.\\n\\nHowever STT - Securities Transaction tax is not eligible for deduction where\\n\\nyou show such income under the head capital gain.\\n\\nIn which year capital gain is taxable ?\\n\\nCapital gain taxable in the year in which such stocks or MF are sold,\\n\\nIrrespective of whether you have withdrawn such profits to bank account or\\n\\nnot you are liable to pay capital gain tax at the time which you sell the stocks\\n\\nand book profits.\\n\\nShort Term Capital Gain on Shares (Section 111A of Income Tax Act) - STCG Tax Rate & Calculation\\n\\nUpdated on: Mar 28th, 2024 | 8 min read\\n\\nAny profit or gain that arises from the sale of shares is treated as Capital\\n\\ngains under the Income Tax Act. Capital gains are further classified as\\n\\nshort-term or long-term based on their holding period. Gains from equity\\n\\nshares listed on a recognised stock exchange having a holding period of\\n\\nless than 12 months are considered short-term capital gains. Short-term\\n\\ncapital gains (STCG) from shares are classified into two parts:\\n\\nShort-term capital gains as per section 111A\\n\\nShort-term capital gains other than section 111A\\n\\nSTCG Tax Rate on shares (Section 111A)\\n\\nShort-term capital gain under Section 111A is taxed at a concessional\\n\\nrate of 15% with applicable cess.\\n\\nShort Term Capital Gains (STCG) under Section 111A\\n\\n1. Applicable on certain assets:\\n\\nSection 111A is applicable in the case of STCG on the purchase or sale\\n\\nof:\\n\\nequity shares or\\n\\nunits of equity-oriented mutual funds or\\n\\nunits of business trust\\n\\n2. Conditions for availing concessional rate under Section 111A\\n\\nTransferred through a recognized stock exchange\\n\\nSuch transaction is liable to securities transaction tax (STT)\\n\\nException: Transactions undertaken on an International Financial\\n\\nService Center (IFSC) would be taxable at the concessional rate of 15%\\n\\neven though STT is not leviable.\\n\\n3. Adjustment of STCG u/s 111A against basic exemption limit\\n\\nIf you are an Indian resident as per income tax and your total income\\n\\nafter all the deductions is lower than the basic exemption limit (i.e. basic\\n\\nexemption limit not exhausted) then you are entitled to set off your\\n\\nshort-term capital gains and long-term capital gains, against the\\n\\nshortfall in your basic exemption limit and only the balance amount will\\n\\nbe taxed at 15%.\\n\\nNote: Non-residents, would not be allowed to claim the exemption limit\\n\\nand shall be required to pay a tax of 15% on such STCG under section\\n\\n111A.\\n\\nLet us understand this by some illustrations –\\n\\nIllustration 1: Ajay has a taxable salary income of only Rs 1 lakh and a\\n\\nshort-term capital gain on the sale of equity shares of Rs 4 lakh. He also\\n\\nhas Rs 50,000 as Income from Other Sources. Calculate the STCG Tax\\n\\napplicable.\\n\\nSalary Income\\n\\nSTCG\\n\\nIncome from Other Sources\\n\\nTotal income\\n\\nRs 1 lakhs\\n\\nRs 4 lakhs\\n\\nRs 0.5 lakhs\\n\\nRs 5.5 lakhs\\n\\nYou have to add income from other sources of Rs 50,000 to the total\\n\\ntaxable salary thereby making it Rs 1.5 Lakh. As there is a shortfall in\\n\\nthe absorption of the basic income tax exemption limit of Ajay by Rs 1\\n\\nlakh, short-term capital gain on the sale of equity can be adjusted to the\\n\\nextent of Rs 1 lakh.\\n\\nTax will be applicable on a short-term capital gain of Rs 3 lakh (Rs 4 lakh\\n\\n– Rs 1 Lakh) at a flat rate of 15%.\\n\\nSuppose he was a non-resident, then he would not be allowed to claim\\n\\nthe exemption limit for such STCG and shall be required to pay a tax of\\n\\n15% on full value of the STCG.\\n\\nIllustration 2: Mr. A (resident and 59 years old) earns a monthly pension\\n\\nof INR 5,000. He purchased shares of ABC Ltd. in January 2024 and sold\\n\\nthe same in March 2024 (sold on NSE and STT levied). Such a sale gave\\n\\nrise to an STCG of INR 1.5 lacs. Apart from pension income and gain on\\n\\nthe sale of shares, he has also made an STCG on property sale\\n\\namounting to INR 1.3 lac. What is his tax liability for the year 2023-24?\\n\\nMr. A has these three incomes:\\n\\nSTCG referred to in 111A- INR 1.5 lacs\\n\\nOther STCG (sale of the property)- INR 1.3 lac\\n\\npension income- INR 60,000\\n\\nThe income calculation and taxes thereon shall be calculated as follows,\\n\\nHe shall first adjust Rs 60,000 against the basic exemption\\n\\nlimit of INR 2.5 lacs.\\n\\nThen Rs.1.3 lac from the sale of property against the\\n\\nremaining INR 1.9 lacs (2.5 lacs-60,000).\\n\\nSTCG on the sale of equity shares shall be adjusted at the end\\n\\nagainst the balance of Rs 60,000 (2.5 lacs- 1.9 lacs).\\n\\nTherefore, he is required to discharge tax @ 15% on the\\n\\nbalance STCG of INR 90,000 (1.5 lacs- 60,000) along with a\\n\\ncess of 4%.\\n\\nPoints to be noted-\\n\\nIf your total income including STCG after applicable tax\\n\\ndeductions is below Rs 2.5 Lakh, then your total tax liability is\\n\\nnil and also no liability will arise us/ 111A as deduction up to\\n\\nthe basic tax exemption limit is allowed\\n\\nHowever, if your total income including STCG is more than Rs\\n\\n2.5 Lakhs, then a flat 15% on STCG will be levied. (However,\\n\\nrebate u/s 87A will be available if total income is less than 5\\n\\nlakhs i.e. up to Rs 12,500 of tax liability as per current income\\n\\ntax regime)\\n\\n4. No Deductions from STCG under section 80C-80U\\n\\nIncome tax law does not allow any deduction under sections 80C to 80U\\n\\nfrom the short-term capital gains referred to in section 111A. However,\\n\\nthe investor can claim such deduction on short-term capital gains other\\n\\nthan those covered under section 111A.\\n\\nExample: Mr A(resident and 59 years old) purchased shares of ABC Ltd.\\n\\nin January 2020 and sold the same in March 2020 (sold on NSE and STT\\n\\nis levied). Such a sale gave rise to an STCG of INR 1.5 lacs. Apart from\\n\\nSTCG, he does not have any other income. He has invested INR 1.5 lacs\\n\\nin the Public Provident Fund and wants to claim a deduction of such\\n\\namount under section 80C. Can he do so?\\n\\nIn the given case, Mr A cannot claim such a deduction under 80C\\n\\nagainst the STCG as it is a gain referred to in section 111A. Therefore,\\n\\nhis taxable income will be INR 1.5 lacs which can be adjusted against\\n\\nthe basic exemption limit.\\n\\n5. Set off & carry forward of losses\\n\\nWhen an individual sells listed equity shares or mutual funds that they\\n\\nhave held for up to 12 months at a loss, it is considered a Short-Term\\n\\nCapital Loss (STCL). The Indian Income Tax rules allow taxpayers to set\\n\\noff STCL from one capital asset against Short Term Capital Gains\\n\\n(STCG) and Long Term Capital Gains (LTCG) from another capital asset.\\n\\nThis means that if an individual has incurred an STCL from the sale of\\n\\none capital asset, they can use it to offset gains from the sale of another\\n\\ncapital asset within the same financial year.\\n\\nIn addition, a taxpayer can carry forward any remaining STCL for up to 8\\n\\nfuture years and use it to set off against future STCG and LTCG only.\\n\\nInstances of STCG covered under Section 111A\\n\\nSTCG on sale of equity shares of a listed company through\\n\\nthe recognised stock exchange and liable to STT\\n\\nSTCG on sale of units of equity-oriented mutual funds\\n\\nthrough a recognised stock exchange and liable to STT\\n\\nSTCG on sale of units of business trust\\n\\nSTCG on sale of equity shares, units of business trust or\\n\\nunits of equity-oriented mutual funds through a recognised\\n\\nstock exchange located in IFSC (International Financial\\n\\nService Centre) where consideration is paid in foreign\\n\\ncurrency, even if STT is not liable.\\n\\nExample of STCG under Section 111A\\n\\nAjay sold equity shares of XYZ Ltd (Indian company) on BSE\\n\\nat a profit after holding them for a period of 8 months. What\\n\\nwill be the rate applicable on the STCG?\\n\\nAns-As the holding period is less than 12 months gains are\\n\\nclassified as short term capital gains. The equity shares are\\n\\ntransferred through a recognised stock exchange (STT being\\n\\npaid ), this case is covered under Section 111A. STCG will be\\n\\ncharged at 15% (plus surcharge and cess as applicable).\\n\\nPuneet sold units of a mutual fund (with more than 65%\\n\\ncorpus vested in equity) through NSE at a profit after holding\\n\\nthem for a period of 11 months. What will be capital gains tax\\n\\napplicable?\\n\\nAns-The sale of mutual funds is covered under Section 111A\\n\\nas the fund is an ‘equity-oriented mutual fund’. As units were\\n\\nheld for less than 12 months, gains are considered as\\n\\nshort-term capital gains. STCG will be charged at 15% (plus\\n\\nsurcharge and cess as applicable).\\n\\nIyer sold units of a debt fund after holding them for a period\\n\\nof 10 months. What will be the capital gain tax applicable on\\n\\nprofits?\\n\\nAns- The capital gains in this case are not covered under\\n\\nSection 111A as Iyer sold units of a debt fund. STCG other\\n\\nthan those applicable to Section 111A is chargeable to tax at\\n\\nthe normal rate applicable. The normal rate applicable will be\\n\\ndetermined on the basis of his total income.\\n\\nFrequently Asked Questions\\n\\nIs the benefit of indexation available while computing capital gain arising on the transfer of short-term capital assets?\\n\\nIndexation is a process by which the cost of acquisition/improvement of\\n\\na capital asset is adjusted against an inflationary rise in the value of the\\n\\nasset. The benefit of indexation is available only in the case of long-term\\n\\ncapital assets and is not available in the case of short-term capital\\n\\nassets.\\n\\nWhat is ‘transfer’ as per Income-tax law?\\n\\nGenerally, transfer means a sale, however, for the purpose of Income-tax\\n\\nLaw \"Transfer”, in relation to a capital asset includes:\\n\\ni. Sale, exchange or relinquishment of the asset;\\n\\nii. Extinguishment of any rights in relation to a capital asset;\\n\\niii. Compulsory acquisition of an asset;\\n\\niv. Conversion of capital asset into stock-in-trade;\\n\\nv. Maturity or redemption of a zero coupon bond;\\n\\nvi. Allowing possession of immovable properties to the buyer in part\\n\\nperformance of the contract;\\n\\nvii. Any transaction which has the effect of transferring an (or enabling\\n\\nthe enjoyment of) immovable property; or\\n\\nviii. Disposing of or parting with an asset or any interest therein or\\n\\ncreating any interest in any asset in any manner whatsoever.\\n\\nIs the benefit of a basic exemption limit available for NRI in the case of STCG u/s 111A?\\n\\nNo, the non-resident Indian (NRI) will not be eligible to get the benefit of\\n\\nthe basic exemption limit for STCG under section 111A.\\n\\nIncome Tax - Latest Updates, Basics, Tax Slabs, Rules, Income Tax Guide 2024-25\\n\\nUpdated on: May 17th, 2024 | 62 min read Switch Language\\n\\nWhat’s New In Income Tax\\n\\nInterim Budget 2024 -\\n\\nThe budget maintained the existing tax rates for both direct and\\n\\nindirect taxes.\\n\\nTaxpayers with income up to Rs 7 lakh have no tax liability.\\n\\nFinance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman also withdraws \\'tax dispute\\'\\n\\nup to Rs 25,000 for the period up to the financial year 2009-10, Rs\\n\\n10,000 for financial years 2010-11 to 2014-15.\\n\\nBudget 2023 Updates\\n\\nFor individuals with income up to Rs 7 lakh, a tax rebate has been\\n\\nintroduced in the New Tax Regime.

Taxes are\\n\\nsources of revenue for the government. The government utilises this revenue\\n\\nfor developing infrastructure, providing healthcare, education, subsidies to the\\n\\nfarmer/agriculture sector and other government welfare schemes.\\n\\nTaxes are mainly of two types: direct taxes and indirect taxes. Tax levied\\n\\ndirectly on the income earned is called a direct tax; for example, Income tax is\\n\\na direct tax. The tax calculation is based on the income slab rates applicable\\n\\nduring that financial year.\\n\\nDirect Taxes are broadly classified as :\\n\\nIncome Tax – This is taxes an individual, a Hindu Undivided Family\\n\\n(HUF), or any taxpayer other than companies pay on the income\\n\\nreceived. The law prescribes the rate at which such income is\\n\\ntaxable.\\n\\nCorporate Tax - This is the tax paid on the company\\'s taxable\\n\\nincome. Here again, a specific tax rate for corporations has been\\n\\nprescribed by the income tax laws of India.\\n\\nWho Should Pay Income Tax? – Types Of Taxpayers\\n\\nAccording to the Income Tax Act, everyone in India, whether resident or\\n\\nnonresident, has to file income tax returns. Currently, tax is payable if the\\n\\nincome exceeds Rs 3 lakh in a financial year. The Income Tax Act has\\n\\nclassified taxpayers into various categories. Different tax rules apply to\\n\\ndifferent types of taxpayers.\\n\\nBelow are the categories of taxpayers:\\n\\nIndividuals\\n\\nHindu Undivided Family (HUF)\\n\\nFirms\\n\\nCompanies\\n\\nAssociation of Persons(AOP)\\n\\nBody of Individuals (BOI)\\n\\nLocal Authority\\n\\nArtificial Judicial Person\\n\\nFurther, Individuals and HUFs are classified as residents and nonresidents.\\n\\nResident individuals are liable to pay tax on their global income in India, i.e.\\n\\nincome earned in India and abroad. Meanwhile, those who qualify as\\n\\nnonresidents must only pay taxes on income earned or accrued in India. The\\n\\nresidential status has to be determined separately for tax purposes for every\\n\\nfinancial year based on the individual tenure of stay in India. Resident\\n\\nIndividuals are further classified into the mentioned categories for tax\\n\\npurposes:\\n\\nIndividuals less than 60 years of age\\n\\nIndividuals aged more than 60 but less than 80 years\\n\\nTypes Of Income – What Are The 5 Heads Of Income?\\n\\nEveryone who earns or gets an income in India is subject to income tax (Yes,\\n\\nbe it a resident or a non-resident of India). For simpler classification, the\\n\\nIncome tax department breaks down income into five main heads:\\n\\nHead of\\n\\nNature of Income covered\\n\\nIncome\\n\\nIncome from\\n\\nIncome from savings bank account interest, fixed deposits,\\n\\nOther Sources\\n\\nand winning in lotteries is taxable under this head of\\n\\nincome.\\n\\nIncome from\\n\\nHouse\\n\\nProperty\\n\\nIncome from\\n\\nCapital Gains\\n\\nIncome from\\n\\nBusiness and\\n\\nProfession\\n\\nIncome earned from renting a house property is taxable\\n\\nunder this head of income.\\n\\nSurplus Income from the sale of a capital asset such as\\n\\nmutual funds, shares, house property, etc, is taxable under\\n\\nthis head of Income.\\n\\nProfits earned by self-employed individuals, businesses,\\n\\nfreelancers or contractors and income earned by\\n\\nprofessionals like life insurance agents, chartered\\n\\naccountants, doctors and lawyers who have their own\\n\\npractice, and tuition teachers are taxable under this head.\\n\\nIncome from\\n\\nIncome earned from salary and pension is taxable under\\n\\nSalary\\n\\nthis head of income.\\n\\nTaxpayers and Tax Slabs\\n\\nEach of these taxpayers is taxed differently under the Indian income tax laws.\\n\\nWhile firms and Indian companies have a fixed rate of tax calculated on\\n\\ntaxable income, the individual, HUF, AOP and BOI taxpayers are taxed based\\n\\non the income slab they fall under. People\\'s income grouped into blocks are\\n\\ncalled tax brackets or tax slabs. And each tax slab has a different tax rate.\\n\\nThe rate at which the tax is charged increases as the taxable income\\n\\nincreases.\\n\\nWhat is the Existing/Old Income Tax Regime?\\n\\nThe old tax regime provides three slab rates for income tax levy, which are\\n\\n5%, 20%, and 30% for different income brackets. Individuals can continue\\n\\nwith the old taxation regime, and they can claim the following deductions:\\n\\nDeductions of allowances like Leave Travel Concession (LTC),\\n\\nHouse Rent Allowance (HRA), and specific other allowances.\\n\\nDeductions for tax-saving investments as per Section 80C (LIC,\\n\\nPPF, NPS, etc) to 80U can be claimed.\\n\\nStandard deduction of Rs 50,000.\\n\\nDeduction for interest paid on home loan.\\n\\nTax slab rates applicable for Individual taxpayers below 60 years for the Old\\n\\ntax regime are as below:\\n\\nIncome Range\\n\\nTax\\n\\nTax to be paid\\n\\nrate\\n\\nUp to Rs 2,50,000\\n\\n0\\n\\nNo tax\\n\\nRs 2.5 lakhs - Rs 5\\n\\n5%\\n\\n5% of your taxable income\\n\\nlakhs\\n\\nRs 5 lakhs - Rs 10\\n\\n20%\\n\\nRs 12,500+20% on income above Rs 5 lakh\\n\\nlakhs\\n\\nAbove 10 lakhs\\n\\n30%\\n\\nRs 1,12,500+30% on income above Rs 10\\n\\nlakh\\n\\nThere are two other tax slabs for two other age groups: those 60 and older\\n\\nand those above 80.\\n\\nA word of note: People often misunderstand that if they earn, let\\'s say, Rs12\\n\\nlakh, they will be paying a 30% tax on Rs.12 lakh, i.e. Rs 3,60,000. This is\\n\\nincorrect. A person earning Rs 12 lakh in the progressive tax system will pay\\n\\nRs 1,12,500 + Rs 60,000 = Rs 1,72,500.\\n\\nIncome Tax Slabs Under New Tax Regime\\n\\nIn the 2020 budget, a new tax regime was introduced with lower tax rates and\\n\\nlimited deductions/exemptions for Individuals and HUFs. Hence, many\\n\\ntaxpayers did not opt for the new tax regime. However, to encourage\\n\\ntaxpayers to adopt the new tax regime in Budget 2023, the income tax slabs\\n\\nunder the new tax regime for FY 2023-24 (AY 2024-25) are revised as follows:\\n\\nNew tax regime FY 2023-24\\n\\nNew tax regime FY 2022-23\\n\\n(After budget)\\n\\n(Before budget)\\n\\nIncome up to Rs 3 lakh\\n\\nNil\\n\\nUp to Rs 2.5 lakh\\n\\nNil\\n\\nRs 3 lakh to Rs 6 lakh\\n\\nRs 6 lakh to Rs 9 lakh\\n\\nRs 9 lakh to Rs 12 lakh\\n\\nRs 12 lakh to Rs 15 lakh\\n\\nIncome above Rs 15 lakh\\n\\n5%\\n\\nRs 2.5 lakh to Rs 5 lakh\\n\\n10% Rs 5 lakh to Rs 7.5 lakh\\n\\n15% Rs 7.5 lakh to Rs 10 lakh\\n\\n20% Rs 10 lakh to Rs 12.5 lakh\\n\\n30% Rs 12.5 lakh to Rs 15 lakh\\n\\n5%\\n\\n10%\\n\\n15%\\n\\n20%\\n\\n25%\\n\\nIncome above Rs 15 lakh\\n\\nMost of the deductions and exemptions are not allowed if the taxpayers opt for\\n\\nthe New Tax regime. However, the exemptions and deductions available\\n\\nunder the new regime are:\\n\\nTransport allowances in case of a specially-abled person.\\n\\nConveyance allowance received to meet the conveyance\\n\\nexpenditure incurred as part of the employment.\\n\\nAny compensation received to meet the cost of travel on tour or\\n\\ntransfer.\\n\\nDaily allowance received to meet the ordinary regular charges or\\n\\nexpenditures you incur on account of absence from his regular\\n\\nplace of duty.\\n\\nExceptions To The Income Tax Slab\\n\\nOne must remember that not all income can be taxed on a slab basis. Capital\\n\\ngains income is an exception to this rule. Capital gains are taxed depending\\n\\non your asset and how long you’ve owned it. The holding period would\\n\\n30%\\n\\ndetermine if assets are long-term or short-term. The holding period to\\n\\ndetermine the nature of assets differs for different assets. A glance at the\\n\\nholding period, the nature of the assets and the tax rate for each are given\\n\\nbelow.\\n\\nFinancial Year\\n\\nThe financial year is a one-year period that the taxpayers use for accounting\\n\\nand financial reporting purposes. It is the year in which the income is earned.\\n\\nAccording to the Income Tax Act, such a period begins from 1st April of the\\n\\ncalendar year to 31st March of the next calendar year. It is abbreviated as\\n\\n“FY”. For example, the financial year starting from 1st April 2023 and ending\\n\\non 31st March 2024 can be written as FY 2023-24.\\n\\nIn simple words, a financial year is a year in which the income of a person is\\n\\nearned.\\n\\nAssessment Year\\n\\nThe one year from 1st April to 31st March starting immediately after the\\n\\nfinancial year is termed an assessment year. This period is the assessment\\n\\nyear because all the taxpayers have to evaluate their income earned in the\\n\\nfinancial year and pay taxes this year. For example, for incomes earned\\n\\nduring the FY 2023-24, the assessment year will be AY 2024-25.\\n\\nIn simple words, the income earned in the financial year will be assessed to\\n\\ntax in the assessment year.\\n\\nAssessee\\n\\nThe assessee is a person or a group who assesses his/her income and pays\\n\\ntax as per the Income Tax Act. The assessee can be an individual, a\\n\\npartnership firm, a company, an Association of Persons (AOP), a Trust, etc.\\n\\nWhat is PAN?\\n\\nPAN is an abbreviation for the Permanent Account Number. It is a unique\\n\\n10-digit alphanumeric digit issued by the Income Tax Department to Indian\\n\\ntaxpayers. All the tax-related transactions and information of a person are\\n\\nrecorded against their unique permanent account number. When the person\\n\\nhas to pay advance tax or self-assessment tax, they must mention the PAN\\n\\nnumber.\\n\\nAlso, an individual submits his PAN to certain entities like banks, mutual fund\\n\\ncompanies, etc. The financial information from such entities goes to the\\n\\nincome tax department via PAN. This allows the taxman to link all tax-related\\n\\nactivities with the department. Hence, just by putting in a permanent account\\n\\nnumber, the taxman can identify all your financial transactions.\\n\\nWhat is TAN?\\n\\nTAN is an abbreviation for Tax Deduction and Collection Account Number. It is\\n\\na unique 10-digit alphanumeric digit allotted by the Income Tax Department of\\n\\nIndia. All persons responsible for deduction (TDS) or collection of tax (TCS)\\n\\nare required to obtain TAN. It is compulsory to quote the TAN in TDS/TCS\\n\\nreturn, any TDS/TCS payment challan, and TDS/TCS certificates.\\n\\nResidents and Non-Residents\\n\\nLevy of income tax in India is dependent on the residential status of a\\n\\ntaxpayer. Individuals who qualify as a resident in India must pay tax on their\\n\\nglobal income in India, i.e. income earned in India and abroad. Whereas,\\n\\nthose who qualify as Non-residents need to pay taxes only on their Indian\\n\\nincome. The residential status has to be determined separately for every\\n\\nfinancial year for which income and taxes are computed.\\n\\nIncome Tax Payment\\n\\nTax Deducted at Source (TDS)\\n\\nFor specified payments, tax is deducted at source when paying the recipient\\n\\nof income. The income recipient can claim credit of the TDS amount by\\n\\nadjusting it with the final tax liability.\\n\\nAdvance Tax\\n\\nThe taxpayer must pay tax in advance when his estimated income tax liability\\n\\nfor the year exceeds Rs 10,000. The government has specified due dates for\\n\\npayment of advance tax installments.\\n\\nSelf-Assessment Tax\\n\\nIt is the balance tax that the taxpayer has to pay on the assessed income. The\\n\\nself-assessment tax is calculated after reducing the advance tax and TDS\\n\\nfrom the total income tax calculated on the assessed income.\\n\\nFiling Your ITR\\n\\nE-filing of income tax return has been made mandatory for all classes of\\n\\ntaxpayers, barring a few exceptions:\\n\\nTaxpayers aged 80 and above need not e-file the return.\\n\\nTaxpayers having an income less than Rs 5 lakhs and not claiming\\n\\na refund need not e-file the return.\\n\\nFor the rest, E-filing is mandatory. Do note that deadlines for filing returns\\n\\nhave also been prescribed. For most individual taxpayers, the due date for\\n\\nfiling the return of income is 31 July, immediately following the concerned\\n\\nfinancial year. If you do not file on time, here are some disadvantages:\\n\\nYou will be denied carry forward of losses (except house property\\n\\nloss) to future years.\\n\\nDelay processing of refund claims if any.\\n\\nDifficulty on getting home loans.\\n\\nLevy of late filing fee upto Rs 5,000 (if the total income is above Rs 5\\n\\nlakh) and Rs 1,000 (if the total income is below Rs 5 lakh) under\\n\\nSection 234F.\\n\\nLevy of interest under 234A if there are taxes due as on 31 July.\\n\\nE-filing is a better alternative to filing on the income tax website. Also, it is for\\n\\nmore than just e-filing your income tax return.\\n\\nIncome Tax Return\\n\\nThe taxpayer shall file an income tax return every year via ITR forms\\n\\nprescribed by the income tax department. The government has prescribed\\n\\nseven ITR forms through which the taxpayer can file his income tax return.\\n\\nThe taxpayer has to choose the appropriate ITR forms and file his income tax\\n\\nreturn.\\n\\nIncome Tax Forms List\\n\\nThe seven ITR forms are:\\n\\nITR-1: Individuals (residents) having income from salary, one\\n\\nhouse property, other sources, agricultural income less than Rs\\n\\n5,000 and with a total income of up to Rs 50 lakh.\\n\\nITR-2: Individuals/HUFs not having any business or profession\\n\\nunder any proprietorship, more than one house property.\\n\\nITR-3: Individuals/HUFs having income from a proprietary\\n\\nbusiness or profession, income of a person as a partner in a firm.\\n\\nITR-4: Individuals/HUFs having presumptive income from business\\n\\nor profession, one house property.\\n\\nITR-5: Partnership firms or LLPs.\\n\\nITR-6: Companies.\\n\\nITR-7: Trusts.\\n\\nDocuments Required for ITR Filing\\n\\nForm 16, Form 26AS, AIS, TIS, Form 16A, proof of tax saving investments\\n\\nmade, bank account details, etc, are some of the crucial\\n\\ninformation/documents you need to be ready with before filing your return.\\n\\nFurther, the documents you will need to file your tax return will largely depend\\n\\non your source of income. Here is our detailed article on documents you need\\n\\nfor filing of your return of income.\\n\\nHow can I calculate my income tax?\\n\\nIndividuals should calculate income tax depending on the nature of their\\n\\nincome. The salaried individual can take the eligible exemptions available for\\n\\nvarious allowances received. Individuals/HUF can take a deduction under\\n\\nSections 80C to 80U, deduct it from the gross total income, and calculate the\\n\\nincome tax liability. Also, the total income tax liability should be adjusted by\\n\\nthe taxes paid, such as advance tax, TDS, etc.\\n\\nAlso, the taxpayer should apply the effect of rebate under Section 87A and\\n\\nrelief under Section 89, Section 90, and Section 91 to arrive at the net amount\\n\\nof income tax payable.\\n\\nAny income that you receive should form part of your income tax return. Of\\n\\ncourse, the law provides exemptions for certain incomes, e.g. LTCG on listed\\n\\nequity shares up to Rs 1 lakh in any financial year, agricultural income, etc.\\n\\nTherefore, here is a quick guideline you can probably follow to compute taxes\\n\\ndue on your income:\\n\\nList down all your income – be it salary, rental income, capital\\n\\ngains, interest income or profits from your business or profession.\\n\\nRemove incomes that are exempt under the law.\\n\\nClaim all applicable deductions available under every source of\\n\\nincome. E.g., claim a standard deduction of Rs 50,000 from salary\\n\\nincome, claim municipal taxes from rental income, claim\\n\\nbusiness-related expenses from your business turnover, etc.\\n\\nClaim all applicable exemptions under every head of income, e.g.,\\n\\namount reinvested in another house property can be claimed as\\n\\nexemption from capital gains income, etc.\\n\\nClaim applicable deductions from your total income, e.g. the\\n\\nSection 80 deductions like 80C, 80D, 80TTA, 80TTB, etc.\\n\\nYou will now arrive at your taxable income. Check the tax slab you\\n\\nfall under and accordingly arrive at your income tax payable.\\n\\nThe government keeps introducing and altering tax slabs, schemes and tax\\n\\nbenefits, so it’s a good idea to keep up with the Budget.\\n\\nWhat Is Computation Of Income?\\n\\nThe process of calculating taxable income after taking into account the\\n\\nincome from all the five heads (salary, house property, capital gains, business\\n\\nor profession, and other sources), exemptions, deductions, rebates, set off of\\n\\nlosses, etc., is called computation of income. After the computation of income,\\n\\nthe taxpayer can compute the income tax liability as per the Income Tax Act.\\n\\nRebate u/s 87A\\n\\nRebates under Section 87A allow taxpayers to reduce their income tax liability.\\n\\nIf you are a resident individual and the amount of your total income after\\n\\nreducing Chapter VI-A deductions (Section 80C, 80D, 80U, etc) does not\\n\\nexceed Rs 5 lakh in a financial year, you can claim a tax rebate up to Rs\\n\\n12,500. This means if your total tax payable is less than Rs 12,500, then you\\n\\nwill not have to pay any tax.\\n\\nIn Budget 2023, a tax rebate on income of Rs 7 lakhs has been introduced\\n\\nunder the new tax regime, and no changes have been made in the 2024\\n\\ninterim budget. Therefore, you do not have to pay tax if your taxable income is\\n\\nup to Rs 7 lakhs under the new tax regime.\\n\\nE-File Returns\\n\\nThe taxpayer shall electronically file the income tax return through the e-filing\\n\\nplatform of the IT department. To file the income tax return, the taxpayer\\n\\nshould register at www.incometax.gov.in. After that, the taxpayer can log in to\\n\\nthe website and file his ITR. Also, there is no need to manually send the\\n\\nacknowledgement of the return to the income tax department. The income tax\\n\\ndepartment now allows e-verification of the ITR in different ways, which\\n\\ncompletes the income tax return process.\\n\\nWhat is ITR–V?\\n\\nForm ITR-V is an income tax return verification form generated after the\\n\\ntaxpayer files income tax return and submits it to the income tax department.\\n\\nThe ITR-V should be e-verified or must be sent to CPC Bangalore at “Income\\n\\nTax Department – CPC, Post Box No – 1, Electronic City Post Office,\\n\\nBangalore – 560100, Karnataka” for verification. The ITR processing takes\\n\\nplace only if its verification is completed.\\n\\nIncome Tax Saving Instruments\\n\\nA taxpayer can save tax by tax planning. A taxpayer can do tax planning by\\n\\ninvesting in tax-saving instruments. It helps in reducing the income tax liability.\\n\\nSection 80C to 80U of the Income Tax Act allows a deduction for certain\\n\\nexpenditures and investments from the total computed income if taxes paid\\n\\nunder the old tax regime. Some of the popular Section 80C investments are:\\n\\nPopular Section 80C Investments\\n\\nParticulars\\n\\nELSS\\n\\nPPF\\n\\nNSC\\n\\n5-Year Tax\\n\\nSCSS\\n\\nSaving FD\\n\\nSection 80C\\n\\nYes\\n\\nYes\\n\\nYes\\n\\nYes\\n\\nYes\\n\\nBenefit\\n\\nType of\\n\\nEquity\\n\\nFixed\\n\\nFixed\\n\\nFixed Income Fixed\\n\\nInvestment\\n\\nIncome\\n\\nIncome\\n\\nIncome\\n\\nLock-in Period\\n\\n3 Years\\n\\n15 Years\\n\\n5 Years\\n\\n5 Years\\n\\n5 Years\\n\\nMaximum\\n\\nNo Max\\n\\nRs 1.5\\n\\nNo Max\\n\\nRs 1.5 lakh\\n\\nRs 15\\n\\nInvestment\\n\\nLimit\\n\\nlakh\\n\\nLimit\\n\\nlakh\\n\\nELSS and NSC have no upper investment limit. However, you get tax\\n\\nbenefits under Section 80C only up to Rs 1.5 lakh per financial year.\\n\\nHealth Insurance and Medical Expense Deduction\\n\\nApart from the Section 80C deduction, a taxpayer can also take a tax benefit\\n\\nunder Section 80D for health insurance premium and medical expenditure\\n\\nincurred for self, family and parents.\\n\\nPerson insured\\n\\nMaximum deduction\\n\\nMaximum deduction\\n\\nBelow 60 years\\n\\n60 years or older\\n\\nYou, your spouse, your\\n\\nRs. 25,000\\n\\nRs. 50,000\\n\\nchildren\\n\\nYour parents\\n\\nRs. 25,000\\n\\nRs. 50,000\\n\\nPreventative health checkup\\n\\nRs. 5,000\\n\\nRs. 5,000\\n\\nMaximum deduction (includes\\n\\nRs. 50,000\\n\\nRs. 1,00,000\\n\\npreventive health checkup)\\n\\nEducation Loan Deduction\\n\\nUnder Section 80E, the taxpayer can claim a deduction for the interest paid on\\n\\na loan taken for higher education. There is no limit to claiming such a\\n\\ndeduction in the income tax return.\\n\\nHome Loan Deduction\\n\\nUnder Section 24, the taxpayer can claim a deduction for interest paid on a\\n\\nhousing loan during the relevant financial year. The deduction amount will\\n\\ndepend upon whether the house is self-occupied or let out. The taxpayer can\\n\\nalso claim a deduction of the principal amount of the loan under Section 80C\\n\\nup to Rs 1.5 lakh.\\n\\nDeduction on\\n\\nMaximum\\n\\nMaximum allowed (for\\n\\nallowed (for\\n\\nproperty on rent)\\n\\nself-occupied\\n\\nhouse property)\\n\\nStamp duty and\\n\\nRs 1,50,000\\n\\nRs 1,50,000 within the overall\\n\\nregistration + principal\\n\\nwithin the overall\\n\\nlimit of Section 80C\\n\\nlimit of Section\\n\\n80C\\n\\nDeduction on home loan\\n\\nRs 2,00,000\\n\\nNo cap (but rental income\\n\\ninterest under Section\\n\\nmust be shown in the income\\n\\n24\\n\\ntax return).

It facilitates the seamless buying and selling\\n\\nof shares of publicly listed companies. The two primary stock exchanges are the\\n\\nNational Stock Exchange (NSE) and the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE).Stocks\\n\\nrepresent fractional or part ownership of a company, and the stock market helps\\n\\ninvestors buy and sell these stocks. Anyone who buys and sells shares on the stock\\n\\nexchange, including individuals and corporations, is a market participant.SEBI regulates\\n\\nthe capital markets in India. Several market participants such as stock market brokers,\\n\\ndepositories, depository participants and clearing corporations ensure the smooth\\n\\nfunctioning of the stock market in India.\\n\\nHow to invest in the stock market?\\n\\nYou must register yourself with a stockbroker or a Depository Participant such as a bank\\n\\nto invest in the stock market. It is vital to pick the suitable Depository Participant or\\n\\nstockbroker before you commence your investment in the stock market. For instance,\\n\\nmany investors opt for Demat and Trading Accounts from banks for convenience.The\\n\\nshares you purchase are stored in electronic form in your Demat account. Moreover,\\n\\nDemat Accounts are maintained by the two depositories, CDSL (Central Depository\\n\\nServices Ltd) and NSDL (National Securities Depository Limited).Your trading account\\n\\nhelps you buy and sell shares. You must complete your KYC requirements through\\n\\nidentity and address verification before opening the Demat and Trading Account.\\n\\nSteps to invest in the stock market:\\n\\n1. You must open a Demat and Trading Account linked with your bank account\\n\\nthrough a stockbroker or Depository Participant.\\n\\n2. Complete KYC by submitting identity proof such as PAN and address proof such\\n\\nas copies of Passport, Driving License or Voter’s ID before opening the Demat\\n\\nand Trading Account.\\n\\n3. You will have to transfer funds from your bank account to your Trading Account\\n\\nto purchase the desired stocks. You cannot buy shares unless you have an\\n\\nonline bank account.\\n\\n4. You will require a Unique Identification Number (UIN) if you want to trade-in\\n\\namounts of Rs one lakh or more at a single time.\\n\\n5. To buy and sell shares, you will have to inform your stockbroker of the name of\\n\\nthe firm whose shares you seek to purchase, the quantity and the share price.\\n\\nAfter the buy trades are executed in your Trading Account and the Stock\\n\\nExchange confirms the transaction, the shares will come into your Demat\\n\\nAccount in T+2 days.\\n\\nWhat time is the share market open?\\n\\nYour trade transactions with a stock exchange will only be processed during business\\n\\nhours. The Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) and the National Stock Exchange (NSE)\\n\\nfollow the same timings.Markets are open between 9:15 a.m and 3:30 p.m from Monday\\n\\nthrough Friday. Stock exchanges are closed on predefined days, and you can find out\\n\\nthe dates on the official calendars of the stock exchange.However, there are sessions\\n\\nthat open even before 9:15 a.m.\\n\\n1. 9 a.m - 9:08 a.m: this pre-opening session allows transactions to be placed by\\n\\ninvestors. The transactions placed in this duration are given preference over\\n\\nothers and are cleared once the actual trading starts. The trade orders can be\\n\\ncanceled or modified by investors ,and one cannot place any trade order once\\n\\nthis window expires.\\n\\n2.\\n\\nin these four minutes, the prices of the securities are determined by matching the\\n\\ndemand and supply prices to ensure there is accuracy in the transactions made\\n\\nby investors. The final prices are determined, through multilateral order matching\\n\\nsystem, at which the actual trading starts once the markets open for regular\\n\\ntrading. The price matching is critical in arriving at the price at which the\\n\\nsecurities are transacted when the regular trading starts 9:15 a.m onwards.\\n\\n3. 9:12 a.m - 9:15 a.m: This window exists to facilitate a smooth transition between\\n\\npre opening and normal trading sessions. No orders can be placed in this\\n\\nduration, and those placed between 9:08 a.m and 9:12 a.m cannot be modified\\n\\nor canceled in this duration.\\n\\nPost 9:15 a.m, investors can place trade orders through 3:30 p.m. The trades placed in\\n\\nthis window follow a bilateral order matching system.\\n\\nHow to learn stock markets?\\n\\nYou must first read books and go through websites on stock market basics to\\n\\nunderstand what shares are and how to invest in them. The first step of investing in the\\n\\nstock market is doing your research or homework.It also helps to understand stock\\n\\nmarkets better by attending seminars and workshops on stocks, taking classes on\\n\\nstocks, and reading books on successful investors.If you seek hands-on practice before\\n\\ninvesting in stocks, you could try a stock market simulator. You could create an account\\n\\non a stock market simulator, choose a set of stocks and see how they perform over\\n\\ntime. It helps you gauge the performance of stocks and the stock market without\\n\\ninvesting any money so that you don\\'t suffer a loss.\\n\\nWhat are blue-chip stocks?\\n\\nBlue-chip stocks are the stocks of financially stable, well-established, and high-quality\\n\\ncompanies that are market leaders in their respective sectors. These companies have\\n\\ngone through various market phases and have weathered the storm of market volatility\\n\\nover the years, and hence, have gained the trust of shareholders and\\n\\ninvestors.Blue-chip companies are generally expected to provide investors with regular\\n\\ndividend payouts and growth over time as these companies have a solid business plan,\\n\\nmanagement, and market positioning. Most conservative investors start their equity\\n\\ninvestment journey with blue-chip companies as they are expected to be relatively\\n\\nstabler.\\n\\nWhat is volume in the stock market?\\n\\nStock market volumes indicate the number of shares bought and sold over time or\\n\\nduring a trading day. For example, the more active the shares, the higher are the\\n\\nvolumes. You can analyse the trends and patterns in the stock market through volumes.\\n\\nShares that are actively traded have high volumes, and those which are not actively\\n\\ntraded have low volumes.Stock exchanges publish trading volumes for every trading\\n\\nsession as the total volume of all stocks that are traded on the stock exchange. Interest\\n\\nin this share is high if there are enormous volumes for a particular share.\\n\\nWhat is LTP in share market? (last traded price)?\\n\\nThe last traded price or LTP is the price at which the stock was most recently sold. The\\n\\nLTP may or may not be the same as the closing price of the day, as the closing price in\\n\\nsome exchanges is calculated as the weighted average of the last few minutes of the\\n\\ntrade. It must be noted that the last traded price is simply the price at which the previous\\n\\ntrade of the security was executed at any given point in time.One must remember that\\n\\nLTP is always a historical number, and the recorded LTP could only be of a few seconds\\n\\nago. Furthermore, when you buy a share, it may be the case that you may have bought\\n\\nit at its LTP. Since trades take place every second, it may not be possible that you have\\n\\ntraded shares at their LTP.\\n\\nWhat is index in stock market?\\n\\nA stock market index, such as the S&P BSE Sensex or NSE Nifty 50, can be\\n\\nconsidered as the benchmark to measure and track the movement of a bundle of\\n\\nshares. One may consider the performance of an index as the base point to compare\\n\\nthe performance of a sector or group of stocks.Indices are of two types; broad and\\n\\nsector-specific. Broad indices are constituted by stocks of every sector, for example-\\n\\nBSE Sensex, while sector-specific indices comprise stocks of a given sector, for\\n\\nexample - NSE Nifty Bank.Indices measure the performance (price-based) of baskets of\\n\\nshares with the help of standardized methodology and metric systems. Furthermore,\\n\\nindices exist to aid the measurement of important financial and economic data such as\\n\\ninflation, interest rates in the economy, and manufacturing output.\\n\\nHow to analyse stocks?\\n\\nTo analyse the performance of a stock, you would need to conduct fundamental and\\n\\ntechnical analysis. Fundamental analysis is a tool to measure a stock\\'s intrinsic value by\\n\\nscrutinizing its fundamental factors (financial and economic). Under this, you will\\n\\nexamine everything that may have a direct impact on the share price, ranging from\\n\\nmacroeconomic factors like the condition of the economy, industry trends, compliance\\n\\nand legal matters, and the management of the company.The main intention is to deduce\\n\\na number that investors may have as a reference with the share price to determine if the\\n\\nshare is overvalued or undervalued. On the other hand, technical analysis involves\\n\\ndetermining the future movement of the share price with the help of past data.\\n\\nWhat is NSE and BSE in the stock market?\\n\\nA stock exchange is a market where the shares of a public company can be bought and\\n\\nsold by investors. The National Stock Exchange (NSE) and Bombay Stock Exchange\\n\\n(BSE) are the two largest stock exchanges in India. Bombay Stock Exchange,\\n\\nestablished in 1875, is among the oldest stock exchanges in the world. It is also the\\n\\noldest stock exchange in Asia and is located on Dalal Street in Mumbai, Maharashtra,\\n\\nand its market cap stood at a massive Rs 255.003 trillion (US$3.4 trillion) as of Sep\\n\\n2021, making it the ninth-largest stock exchange in the world.The National Stock\\n\\nExchange was established in 1992 by leading banks and financial institutions such as\\n\\ninsurance companies. It is also the first-ever electronic dematerialized stock exchange\\n\\nin India. NSE is based out of Mumbai, and its market cap as of August 2021 was $3.4\\n\\nbillion.\\n\\nWhat is the upper circuit in the share market?\\n\\nStock Exchanges such as BSE and NSE have set up a price band every day to protect\\n\\ninvestors from a single day\\'s reactive drop or hike in share prices.The price band is set\\n\\nup depending on the last traded share price. For example, the upper circuit is the\\n\\nmaximum possible price the stock can trade on a designated day. Moreover, the lower\\n\\ncircuit is the minimum or lowest possible price the stock can trade on that day.Based on\\n\\ntheir criteria, stock exchanges set up limits for stock at 5%, 10%, or 20% on either side.\\n\\nMoreover, a stock that hits the upper circuit has only buyers and no sellers. For\\n\\nexample, positive news could lead to high demand for the shares of a particular\\n\\ncompany, and it hits the upper circuit. A stock hits the upper circuit if there is a higher\\n\\ndemand for its shares as compared to the supply.\\n\\nWhat is PE in the share market?\\n\\nStock Exchanges such as BSE and NSE have set up a price band every day to protect\\n\\ninvestors from a single day\\'s reactive drop or hike in share prices.The PE Ratio or the\\n\\nPrice to Earnings Ratio is used mainly for stock selection. It helps you compare the\\n\\nstock price to the earnings generated by a company. For instance, the PE Ratio\\n\\nmeasures the price the market is willing to pay for every rupee of a company\\'s\\n\\nearnings.P/E Ratio = Current Market Price per share / Earnings per shareYou must\\n\\ndivide the market price per share by the earnings per share or EPS to determine the PE\\n\\nRatio. The P/E Ratio helps you compare the valuations of individual stocks or even\\n\\nstock market indices such as the Nifty 50.\\n\\nSIP - Invest in Best Systematic Investment Plans\\n\\nUpdated on: Mar 17th, 2023\\n\\n|\\n\\n18 min read\\n\\nWhat is A SIP?\\n\\nA systematic Investment Plan, commonly referred to as an SIP, allows you to\\n\\ninvest a small sum regularly in your preferred mutual fund scheme. By\\n\\nactivating an SIP, a fixed amount is deducted from your bank account every\\n\\nmonth, which gets invested in the mutual fund of your choice.\\n\\nPro Tip: Invest in direct funds pay at 0% commission and earn upto 1.5%\\n\\nextra returns Invest Now\\n\\nUnlike a lump sum investment, you spread your investment over time with an\\n\\nSIP. Therefore, you don’t need to have a large amount of money to get started\\n\\nwith your mutual fund investment through SIPs. By investing via an SIP, you\\n\\nare forced to set aside a sum at regular intervals, which help you instil a sense\\n\\nof financial discipline in the long run.\\n\\nHow Do SIPs Work?\\n\\nEvery time you invest in a mutual fund scheme through an SIP, you purchase\\n\\na certain number of fund units corresponding to the amount you invested. You\\n\\ndon’t need to time the markets when investing through an SIP as you benefit\\n\\nfrom both bullish and bearish market trends.\\n\\nWhen the markets are down, you purchase more fund units while you\\n\\npurchase fewer units when the markets are surging. Since NAV of all mutual\\n\\nfunds are updated on a daily basis, the cost of purchase may vary from one\\n\\nSIP instalment to another. Over time, the cost of purchase averages out and\\n\\nturns out to be on the lower side. This is known as rupee cost averaging. This\\n\\nbenefit is not available when you invest a lump sum.\\n\\nBenefits of investing in mutual funds via SIP\\n\\nWith an SIP, you can get started with your investment with a small amount and\\n\\nreap significant returns in the long run. It’s simple and the most convenient\\n\\nway of investing in mutual funds. It also brings financial discipline.\\n\\nConvenience\\n\\nYou can invest in a disciplined and phased manner through an SIP. It gives\\n\\nyou the convenience of starting your investment with as low as Rs 100 a\\n\\nmonth.\\n\\nRupee Cost Averaging\\n\\nSIP helps you invest in equity funds without having to time the stock market.\\n\\nYou invest a fixed amount regularly across stock market levels when you\\n\\ninvest in equity funds through the SIP. It helps you buy more equity fund units\\n\\nwhen the stock markets are crashing and lesser units when markets rise. You\\n\\nwill be averaging out the purchase price of equity fund units over time thereby\\n\\nlessening the impact of short term market fluctuations on your investment.\\n\\nLets understand Rupee Cost Averaging with an Example: Suppose you invest\\n\\nRs 1000 every month in an equity fund through an SIP. Stock markets are\\n\\nhighly volatile and the Net Asset Value (NAV) of the equity fund keeps\\n\\nchanging. It means you will not be able to invest at the same NAV every\\n\\nmonth. If you invest Rs 10,000 every month from January to June in a\\n\\nparticular year your SIP investment could look like this.\\n\\nMonth\\n\\nNAV\\n\\nNumber of Units (Rs 10000/ NAV)\\n\\nJanuary\\n\\n100\\n\\n100\\n\\nFebruary\\n\\n95\\n\\n105\\n\\nMarch\\n\\n96\\n\\n104\\n\\nApril\\n\\n93\\n\\n108\\n\\nMay\\n\\n94\\n\\n106\\n\\nJune\\n\\n98\\n\\n102\\n\\nTotal\\n\\n576\\n\\n625\\n\\nFrom the above example, the average purchase price for units of equity funds\\n\\nwas Rs 96 (576/6) over 6 months and you purchased a total of 625 units. If\\n\\nyou had invested a lump sum amount in January, your purchase price would\\n\\nhave been higher at an NAV of Rs 100 and you would have bought 600 units.\\n\\n(Rs 60,000/100). Therefore, Rupee cost averaging has helped you average\\n\\nout the purchase price of units over time.\\n\\nPower of Compounding\\n\\nPower of Compounding helps you magnify your returns over time. It is\\n\\nbasically a return on your returns from equity mutual funds. For example,\\n\\nsuppose you invest Rs 100 in an equity fund which fetches you returns of 10%\\n\\nper annum. You do not take out your profit from equity funds which is\\n\\neffectively reinvested in the mutual fund and your total corpus is Rs 110. The\\n\\nreturns you now earn from the equity fund are on Rs 110 and not Rs 100\\n\\nwhich is return on your returns.\\n\\nYou can invest in equity funds through the SIP to enjoy the power of\\n\\ncompounding. It helps if you start your SIP as early as possible and stay with\\n\\nyour investment for the long run to enjoy the power of compounding benefit.\\n\\nLets understand the power of compounding with an example. Suppose four\\n\\npeople, Ramesh, Suresh, Mahesh and Uday who are 30, 35, 40 and 45 years\\n\\nold have invested Rs 5,000 per month in equity funds through the SIP. Let\\'s\\n\\nassume equity funds offer an annual return of 12%.\\n\\nThe table below shows their accumulated corpus at retirement at the age of\\n\\n60 years.\\n\\nTime till\\n\\nMonthly\\n\\nAge\\n\\nRetirement\\n\\nInvestment\\n\\nFinal\\n\\nSIP (Rs)\\n\\n(Years)\\n\\n(Years)\\n\\nAmount (Rs)\\n\\nCorpus (Rs)\\n\\nRamesh\\n\\n5,000\\n\\n30\\n\\n30\\n\\n18,00,000\\n\\n1,58,49,569\\n\\nSuresh\\n\\n5,000\\n\\n35\\n\\n25\\n\\n15,00,000\\n\\n94,88,175\\n\\nMahesh\\n\\n5,000\\n\\n40\\n\\n20\\n\\n12,00,000\\n\\n49,95,740\\n\\nUday\\n\\n5,000\\n\\n45\\n\\n15\\n\\n9,00,000\\n\\n25,22,880\\n\\nYou can use SIP Calculator to calculate the investment amount and the final\\n\\ncorpus.\\n\\nInference: As you see from the table, Ramesh has accumulated a corpus of\\n\\nover Rs 1.5 crore. It is way above the accumulated corpus of Suresh, Mahesh\\n\\nand Uday. The primary reason for this is Ramesh has invested for a longer\\n\\nperiod of time. Moreover, the power of compounding benefit has propelled\\n\\nRamesh’s investment to a massive portfolio.\\n\\nLow Initial Investment: You can invest as low as Rs 500 per SIP instalment in\\n\\nequity funds. It helps you start investing for your financial goals without having\\n\\nto wait until you accumulate a lump sum amount. However, it helps if you\\n\\ninvest a higher amount through SIP if you want to attain your long term\\n\\nfinancial goals faster.\\n\\n2x Higher returns than RD\\n\\nELSS mutual funds have the potential to provide much higher returns than\\n\\nbank FDs, PPF and other traditional investment options.\\n\\nEase of Investing\\n\\nInvesting in equity funds through SIP is a convenient way of building wealth\\n\\nover time. It is pocket friendly as you can invest a minimum of Rs 500 per SIP\\n\\ninstallment.SIP gives standing instructions to your bank to deduct the requisite\\n\\namount every month and this amount gets invested in the equity fund.\\n\\nWhy should you invest in SIP Mutual funds?\\n\\nPoeple should invest in SIP mutual funds because The concept of SIPs is\\n\\nfocused on the philosophy of “Save First, Spend Next”.\\n\\nWith an SIP, you can invest small amounts at fixed intervals (weekly, monthly\\n\\nor quarterly) instead of making a one-time investment.\\n\\nPower of Compounding\\n\\nThe rupee cost averaging results when you stagger your investments over a\\n\\nlong period. This ensures that you get much more returns as compared to a\\n\\nlump-sum investment.\\n\\nStart with as low as Rs 100 a month\\n\\nYou can start investing in mutual funds through an SIP with an amount as low\\n\\nas Rs 500. Over time, you can increase your monthly SIPs when you get the\\n\\nfeel of what mutual funds are capable of.\\n\\nRupee Cost Averaging\\n\\nThe equity market is volatile, and when you invest via an SIP, you will buy\\n\\nmore number of units during a slump and less number of units in a booming\\n\\nmarket, and as a result, you would decrease the cost per unit in the long run.\\n\\nBecome a disciplined investor\\n\\nInvesting via an SIP would make you disciplined in terms of managing your\\n\\nfinances. With the option of automated payments, you don’t have to go\\n\\nthrough the hassle of investing manually every month.\\n\\nActs as an Emergency Fund\\n\\nYou can stop your SIPs at any time, and the fund house has no say in this.\\n\\nAlso, you can redeem your investment at any time (if there is no lock-in\\n\\nperiod).\\n\\nWho Should Invest Through SIP?\\n\\nThe first-time mutual fund investors may consider starting their mutual fund\\n\\njourney by initiating an SIP. This is ideal for those having a regular source of\\n\\nincome, such as a salary. You can divert a portion of your regular income\\n\\ntowards mutual fund investments by initiating an SIP. This helps you instil a\\n\\nsense of financial discipline in the long run as you will be forced to set aside a\\n\\nsum at regular intervals.\\n\\nSIP or one-time: How should you invest?\\n\\nOften, first-time investors get confused about choosing between an SIP\\n\\ninvestment or one-time investment.\\n\\nOne-time investment\\n\\nIn this mode of investment, you make a one time payment of a considerable\\n\\nsum of money.\\n\\nMonthly SIP\\n\\nOn the other hand, in an SIP, a fixed amount of sum is deposited at regular\\n\\nintervals of time in a mutual fund scheme. In short, one-time investment mode\\n\\ncan be chosen if you have money in hand right now that can be invested, and\\n\\nan SIP can be chosen if you are expecting a regular inflow of money in future.\\n\\nFirst-time investors are advised to take the SIP route.\\n\\nSIP Investment\\n\\nOne-time Investment\\n\\nPeriodic investments in a\\n\\nOne-time investment in a tenure (lump sum)\\n\\ntenure\\n\\nEarns better during market\\n\\nEarns better during market highs\\n\\nlows\\n\\nSIPs can protect investments\\n\\nOne-time investments can lead to major loss\\n\\nfrom potential market crash\\n\\nduring market crash, which happens often\\n\\nenough\\n\\nHow to Choose Best SIP Mutual funds?\\n\\nThe internet will provide you with the A-Z of the mutual funds you shortlisted\\n\\nincluding their past returns.\\n\\nHowever, you have to make sure that the fund you pick meets the below\\n\\ncriteria.\\n\\nGoals\\n\\nIt is important to ensure that you choose to invest in those funds that help you\\n\\nachieve your goals.\\n\\nYou have to assess your requirements and match them with the objectives of\\n\\nthe fund under consideration before initiating an SIP into it.\\n\\nRisk tolerance\\n\\nIt is essential that you invest only in those funds whose risk level falls under\\n\\nyour risk appetite.\\n\\nIf you are a risk-averse investor, then it is important that you invest in those\\n\\nfunds that carry minimal to no risk.\\n\\n₹500 Crore Asset Under Management\\n\\nA Rs 500 crore asset size can be a reasonable benchmark when selecting a\\n\\nfund. This doesn’t mean that funds below this corpus are bad, but it is not\\n\\nadvisable unless you are willing to take some risk.\\n\\nDuration of SIP\\n\\nThe longer the duration of your SIP, the better. It is advisable to continue your\\n\\nSIP for as long as possible. Even if you don’t invest, you can continue letting\\n\\nyour investment stay invested. This way, you give your investment the time to\\n\\ngrow to a significant sum\\n\\nFund House\\n\\nThe reputation of the fund house is an important factor while choosing a plan\\n\\nas it tells how well they were able to handle market highs and lows without\\n\\nletting their investors feel the impact of fluctuations.\\n\\nHow To Invest in SIP\\n\\nSet Investment Goals\\n\\nEvery mutual fund is built around an objective to achieve. You have to analyse\\n\\nyour requirements and choose that fund which is in sync with your goals and\\n\\nrisk profile. If you are finding it difficult to choose the right mutual fund, then let\\n\\nus know your requirements, we will shortlist funds accordingly.\\n\\nDecide between SIP or lump sum\\n\\nThere are two ways of investing in mutual funds; a lump-sum investment or\\n\\nstagger your investment over time via an SIP. You have to assess your profile\\n\\nand choose to invest either a lump sum or an SIP.\\n\\nKYC\\n\\nAll our mutual fund investments mandate KYC documentation and a net\\n\\nbanking account. Undergoing KYC verification is mandatory as per the norms\\n\\nof the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), without which you\\n\\ncannot invest in mutual funds, and it is a one-time process. There is usually\\n\\nno need to sign cheques and fill out forms if you are investing in mutual funds\\n\\nwith us.\\n\\nInvest in Handpicked Mutual Funds\\n\\nStart an SIP & invest in best performing mutual funds to get better return on\\n\\ninvestment than Bank RDs/ PPF\\n\\nHow to customise your SIPs?\\n\\nMany people, especially salaried employees, prefer monthly SIPs. It is\\n\\nbecause you can quickly transfer the SIP amount from your bank account to\\n\\nthe selected mutual fund when you receive your monthly salary.\\n\\nFrequency of your SIP\\n\\nMutual Fund houses offer you the facility to invest in SIPs through daily,\\n\\nweekly, monthly, or quarterly facilities. Moreover, there are several types of\\n\\nSIPs, and you can choose the ones you prefer depending on your financial\\n\\ngoals.\\n\\nLet\\'s take a look at the different types of SIPs:\\n\\n1. Top-Up SIP\\n\\nTop-Up SIPs allow you to increase your SIP amounts at regular intervals. It is\\n\\ncalled the Step-Up SIP, as you can increase your SIP contributions when your\\n\\nincome grows. You can accumulate a considerable corpus over time and\\n\\nreach financial goals faster through the Top-Up SIP as you enjoy the power of\\n\\ncompounding.\\n\\nLet\\'s understand how Top-Up SIP works with an example. Suppose you invest\\n\\nRs 20,000 per month for 20 years at an expected rate of return of 12%. You\\n\\ncan create a corpus of nearly Rs 2 crore with an investment of Rs 48 lakh.\\n\\nSuppose you decide to Step-Up your SIP by Rs 2,000 every year. You can\\n\\naccumulate a corpus of Rs 3.17 crore against investments of Rs 93.6 lakh. It\\n\\nmeans an additional corpus of around Rs 1.17 crore by increasing your SIP by\\n\\nRs 2,000 per annum.\\n\\n2. Flexible SIP\\n\\nThe flexible SIP allows you to change the amount you want your mutual fund\\n\\nhouse to deduct every month towards your SIP contributions. It offers the\\n\\nfacility to intimate the mutual fund house to stop your SIP instalments until\\n\\nfurther notice if you face a cash crunch. Moreover, you can increase your SIP\\n\\ncontributions for a particular duration if you have surplus cash in your bank\\n\\naccount.\\n\\n3. Perpetual SIP\\n\\nYou must select the SIP tenure when you fill-up the SIP application form. If\\n\\nyou do not specify the SIP tenure, your SIP becomes a perpetual SIP. In\\n\\nsimple terms, the SIP continues for a duration until you provide instructions to\\n\\nthe mutual fund house to stop your investment. Moreover, if you do not want\\n\\nto limit your SIP contributions with a maturity tenure, you can opt for the\\n\\nperpetual SIP variant in the SIP application form.\\n\\n4. Trigger SIP\\n\\nYou can opt for the trigger SIP if you are familiar with stock market\\n\\nmovements.

Your SIP frequency can be\\n\\nweekly, monthly, quarterly, or bi-annually, as per your comfort—every SIP\\n\\ninstalment results in purchasing of the new fund units at the prevailing NAV.\\n\\nOver time, the cost of purchase of fund units averages out and turns out to be\\n\\non the lower side. When you continue your SIP when the markets are down,\\n\\nyou purchase more fund units while you purchase a fewer number of units\\n\\nwhen the markets are down. Therefore, you get the benefit of both falling and\\n\\nsurging markets. This is referred to as rupee cost averaging.

Now, if you decide to\\n\\nredeem your units after 15 months, then those units that were bought through\\n\\nthe first three SIPs provide long-term capital gains as their holding period\\n\\nexceeds 12 months. Long-term capital gains of up to Rs 1 lakh a year are\\n\\ntax-exempt. Any long-term gains above this limit attract a long-term capital\\n\\ngains tax at the rate of 10%, and indexation is not allowed. The units\\n\\npurchased after the third months would not have completed a holding period\\n\\nof 12 months, and hence the capital gains realised through these units are\\n\\nconsidered short-term. These gains are taxed at 15% plus applicable\\n\\nsurcharge and cess.\\n\\nHow to become crorepati by SIP?\\n\\nYou can accumulate Rs 1 crore in your investment account by following the\\n\\nsimple rule of 15*15*15.

Then, you need to switch funds. For this, you will have to redeem your\\n\\nunits held with the current fund at the current NAV. After that, you will\\n\\npurchase the units of a new fund at the prevailing NAV. You have to pay\\n\\napplicable tax on the capital gains realised and exit load if any.

It is necessary for the Government to\\n\\nkeep a tab on such measures by having provisions in the law or introducing\\n\\nnew provisions / modifying the existing ones in order to curb this practice.\\n\\nWhen people started evading capital gains tax by not declaring their profits on\\n\\nthe sale of stocks, the Finance Act, way back in 2004, introduced a tax called\\n\\nthe Securities Transaction Tax (STT) as a clean and efficient way of collecting\\n\\ntaxes from financial market transactions.\\n\\nITR Filing Last Date 2024\\n\\nThe last date to file Income Tax Return (ITR) for FY 2023-24 (AY 2024-25)\\n\\nwithout a late fee is 31st July 2024.\\n\\nWhat is Securities Transaction Tax (STT)?\\n\\nSTT is a kind of financial transaction tax which is similar to tax collected at\\n\\nsource (TCS). STT is a direct tax levied on every purchase and sale of\\n\\nsecurities that are listed on the recognised stock exchanges in India. STT is\\n\\ngoverned by the Securities Transaction Tax Act (STT Act), and the STT Act\\n\\nhas specifically listed down various taxable securities transactions i.e.,\\n\\ntransactions on which STT is leviable.\\n\\nTaxable securities include equity, derivatives, and unit of equity-oriented\\n\\nmutual fund. It also includes unlisted shares sold under an offer for sale to the\\n\\npublic included in IPO and where such shares are subsequently listed in stock\\n\\nexchanges. STT is an amount to be paid over and above transaction value\\n\\nand hence, increases transaction value.\\n\\nAs already mentioned, STT is leviable on taxable securities transactions. STT\\n\\nAct has also provided the value of the transactions on which STT is required\\n\\nto be paid and person who is responsible for paying STT i.e., either buyer or\\n\\nseller. However, rate of STT will be decided by Government and modified from\\n\\ntime to time if necessary.\\n\\nProvisions of collection of STT works similar to TCS or TDS. STT is required\\n\\nto be collected by a recognised stock exchange or by the prescribed person in\\n\\nthe case of every mutual fund or the lead merchant banker in the case of an\\n\\ninitial public offer, as the case may be, and subsequently payable to the\\n\\nGovernment on or before the 7th of the following month. In case the above\\n\\npersons fail to collect the taxes, they are still obliged the discharge an\\n\\nequivalent amount of tax to the credit of the Central Government within the 7th\\n\\nof the following month. Further, failure to collect or remit whatever has been\\n\\ncollected will result in a levy of interest and penal consequences too.\\n\\nFeatures of Securities Transaction Tax\\n\\nSTT is a straightforward direct tax that is simple to compute and impose.\\n\\nSome of STT\\'s most distinguishing characteristics are given below.\\n\\n1. An STT charge is applied on all sell transactions for options and futures.\\n\\n2. For the purposes of STT computation, each ‘futures’ trade is valued at the\\n\\nactual traded price, whereas each option trade is valued at the premium.\\n\\n3. The amount of STT that a clearing member must pay is the aggregate of all\\n\\nSTT taxes owed by trading members under him.\\n\\nSecurities on which STT is Applicable\\n\\nWhile the term ‘securities’ is not defined under the STT Act, the STT Act\\n\\nspecifically allows borrowing of the definition of such terms not defined in the\\n\\nSTT Act but defined in the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956 or\\n\\nIncome-tax Act, 1961. The term ‘Securities’ is defined in the Securities\\n\\nContracts (Regulation) Act and includes the following:\\n\\nShares, scrips, stocks, bonds, debentures, debenture stock or\\n\\nother marketable securities of a like nature in or of any\\n\\nincorporated company or other body corporates.\\n\\nDerivatives.\\n\\nUnits or any other instrument issued by any collective investment\\n\\nscheme to the investors in such schemes.\\n\\nGovernment securities of equity nature.\\n\\nEquity-oriented units of mutual funds.\\n\\nRights or interest in securities.\\n\\nSecuritised debt instruments.\\n\\nHence, securities include all of the above and are traded on the recognized\\n\\nstock exchange for the purpose of STT levy.

However, SEBI had in its Circular\\n\\ndated 11.4.2018 listed around 46 stocks, in respect of which derivative\\n\\ncontracts would be settled by way of physical delivery of shares as against\\n\\ncash. However, no clarity emerged on the rate of STT that would apply to\\n\\nthese kinds of transactions.\\n\\nFurther, for such transactions, the stock exchanges began to levy an STT of\\n\\n0.1 per cent (this is the rate of STT for delivery-based equity share\\n\\ntransactions), which is almost 10 times what is levied for derivative contracts\\n\\nsettled in cash. Hence, a petition was lodged by the Association of National\\n\\nExchange Members of India (ANMI) against the stock exchanges before the\\n\\nBombay High Court to address the aforementioned concern of a levy of 0.1\\n\\nper cent of STT on physical delivery of derivatives.\\n\\nThe High Court has sought the comments of the Central Board of Direct Taxes\\n\\n(CBDT) in this regard. The CBDT, in response, has issued a clarification dated\\n\\n27 August 2018, where it has observed that where a derivative contract is\\n\\nbeing settled by physical delivery of shares, such transaction would be similar\\n\\nto a transaction in equity shares where the contract is settled by actual\\n\\ndelivery of shares. Therefore, the STT rate as applicable to delivery-based\\n\\nequity transactions would apply to such derivative transactions too.\\n\\nSecurities Transaction Tax and Income Tax\\n\\nTax on Capital Gains\\n\\nWhen the STT levy was introduced in 2004, a new Section 10(38) was\\n\\nintroduced to benefit taxpayers who would incur STT. As per income tax law,\\n\\nfor transactions undertaken until 31 March 2018, any capital gain on the sale\\n\\nof shares or equity-oriented mutual fund units (EOMF) which are subject to\\n\\nSTT is taxed at beneficial/Nil rate.\\n\\nWhile long-term capital gains (if shares or EOMF are held for > 12 months)\\n\\nare exempt from tax, short-term capital gains on such securities are taxed at a\\n\\nconcessional rate of 15%. However, in order to prevent abuse of exemption\\n\\nprovisions by certain persons for declaring their unaccounted income as\\n\\nexempt long-term capital gains by entering into sham transactions, the\\n\\nFinance Budget 2018 proposed to withdraw the exemption on long-term\\n\\ncapital gain and tax long-term capital gains on equity shares and EOMF at\\n\\nconcessional rate of 10% with respect to transfer effected on or after 1 April\\n\\n2018.\\n\\nHowever, gains accrued till 31 January 2018 are grandfathered, i.e., in case of\\n\\ntransfers up to 31 January 2018, the cost of acquisition of shares or EOMF\\n\\nacquired before 1 February 2018 will be replaced by fair market value as of\\n\\n31st January 2018.\\n\\nTax on Business Income\\n\\nIf a person is trading in securities and offering income/loss from such trading\\n\\nas business income, STT paid is allowed to be deducted as business\\n\\nexpense.\\n\\nWhen Is Securities Transaction Tax Levied?\\n\\nEach purchase and sale of shares listed on a domestic and recognised stock\\n\\nmarket is subject to a securities transaction tax. The government determines\\n\\nthe taxation rate. Under the STT act, all stock market transactions involving\\n\\nequities or equity derivatives such as futures and options are subject to\\n\\ntaxation. When a share transaction is completed, STT is levied. As a result,\\n\\nSTT is quick, transparent, and effective. Because the tax is imposed as soon\\n\\nas the transaction occurs, incidents of non-payment, incorrect payment, and\\n\\nso on are minimised to a bare minimum. However, the net effect is that it\\n\\nraises the cost of the transactions.\\n\\nSTT Example\\n\\nAssume a dealer purchases 500 shares worth Rs.10,000 at Rs.20 per share\\n\\nand sells them at Rs.30 per share. If the trader sells the shares on the same\\n\\nday, the intraday STT rate of 0.025% will apply.\\n\\nAs a result, STT = 0.025*30*500 = Rs.375.\\n\\nSimilarly, the appropriate STT for futures and options is 0.01%. If a trader\\n\\nbuys 5 lots of Nifty futures at Rs.5,000 and sells them at Rs.5,010, the STT is\\n\\ncalculated as follows:\\n\\nSTT = 0.01*5010*50*5 = Rs.125.25\\n\\nRelated Articles\\n\\n\\n\\nFrequently Asked Questions Is STT a direct or indirect tax?

Depending on your\\n\\ntype of income or category, it is imperative to submit the appropriate ITR form\\n\\non or before the specified due date. If you choose the wrong form, you must\\n\\ngo through the hassle of filing your ITR again.\\n\\nSo, if you are confused between the ITR forms, especially ITR 1 and ITR 4,\\n\\nyou can rely on this article. This article will briefly discuss the forms, helping\\n\\nyou understand the key differences between the two.\\n\\nSignificance of Filing Income Tax Return\\n\\nThe income tax department mandates every earning individual to file ITR.\\n\\nTake a look at some of the reasons why you should not skip filing the\\n\\napplicable ITR:\\n\\nYour tax contributes towards nation-building. For instance, in the\\n\\nfinancial year 2022-23, the Central Government collected Rs 16.61\\n\\nlakh crore from direct tax payments. Henceforth, the government\\n\\ncan utilise this amount for different developmental activities.\\n\\nIt makes the processing of loans relatively easier. If you wish to\\n\\napply for a loan, the concerned lender will ask for your income tax\\n\\nreturn before sanctioning the loan amount.\\n\\nIn case you have suffered heavy losses from your business or\\n\\nprofession, you can carry forward such losses to the next financial\\n\\nyear. All you need to do is file your income tax return.\\n\\nIt permits you to claim your TDS seamlessly. The net tax liability\\n\\ncan be adjusted using TDS while filing your income tax return for\\n\\nthe specified year. If yor TDS or advance tax is more than the net\\n\\ntax liability you can file ITR to claim a refund.\\n\\nSo, if your gross income is taxable, it is crucial to file the ITR applicable to\\n\\nyou. Depending on your income, there are different ITR forms for different\\n\\nindividuals; however, the returns filed by most individuals are ITR-1 (SAHAJ)\\n\\nand ITR-4 (SUGAM). Read on to know the key differences between them.\\n\\nAll About ITR 1\\n\\nITR-1 or SAHAJ is a type of return filing form.

The due date to file ITR in the assessment year\\n\\n2024-25 is 31st July 2024 for the majority of taxpayers.

One of the basic differences between ITR-1 and ITR-4 lies\\n\\nin the presumptive business scheme. This specific provision is applicable to\\n\\nITR-4 but not ITR-1. At the same time, also ensure to file your ITR within a\\n\\nspecified date. If you fail to do so, you will have to pay interest under Section\\n\\n234A at 1% per month.\\n\\nPlan Your Taxes In Advance\\n\\nFrequently Asked Questions What types of income are excluded from the ITR-1 form?
